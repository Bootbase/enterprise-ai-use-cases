summary: "Enterprise customer service organizations face a compounding crisis: rising ticket volumes, growing customer expectations for instant resolution, and a shrinking labor pool willing to work in support roles. Traditional chatbots deflect simple FAQ queries but fail on anything requiring multi-step reasoning, cross-system lookups, or transactional actions (refunds, plan changes, account modifications). The result is that 60-80% of customer interactions still require human agents, creating a cost structure that scales linearly with customer growth."

## Business Impact

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Average cost per customer service interaction is $5-12 for human agents (Gartner). Klarna reduced cost per interaction from $0.32 to $0.19 — a 40% reduction — saving a projected $40M annually. At scale, enterprises spend $50-200M/year on support labor alone. |
| **Time**        | Average resolution time for human agents is 11-15 minutes per interaction. Klarna's AI agent resolves in under 2 minutes (82% improvement). Sierra/Ramp achieves 90% resolution without human handoff, eliminating queue wait times entirely. |
| **Error Rate**  | Human agents make errors in 10-15% of interactions (wrong refund amounts, incorrect policy application, missed follow-ups). Klarna reported a 25% drop in repeat inquiries after AI deployment, indicating higher first-contact resolution quality. However, Klarna also observed quality degradation with over-reliance on AI for complex queries, requiring rebalancing. |
| **Scale**       | Klarna's AI assistant handled 2.3 million conversations in its first month — two-thirds of all customer chats. Intercom Fin is involved in 99% of conversations across its customer base, resolving up to 65% end-to-end. Sierra AI powers hundreds of millions of conversations annually across 40% of Fortune 50 companies. |
| **Risk**        | Customer churn from slow resolution (67% of churn is preventable with first-contact resolution — Harvard Business Review). Compliance risk from inconsistent policy application across human agents. Brand risk from AI hallucinations or unauthorized actions on customer accounts. |

## Current Process (Before AI)

1. Customer contacts support via chat, email, or phone
2. Request enters a queue and waits for an available human agent (average wait: 3-10 minutes)
3. Agent opens the customer's account in CRM (Salesforce, Zendesk, etc.)
4. Agent reads the customer's message and identifies the issue category
5. Agent looks up relevant policies in an internal knowledge base or wiki
6. Agent cross-references order management, billing, or payment systems for transaction details
7. Agent determines the appropriate action (refund, plan change, escalation)
8. Agent executes the action in the relevant backend system
9. Agent drafts and sends a response to the customer
10. Agent updates the ticket with resolution notes for compliance and analytics
11. If the issue is complex, agent escalates to a specialist (Tier 2/3), adding another 24-48 hours

### Bottlenecks & Pain Points

- **Linear cost scaling**: Every new customer requires proportionally more support agents — headcount grows 1:1 with volume
- **Agent ramp time**: New support agents take 4-8 weeks to become proficient; annual turnover in contact centers averages 30-45%
- **Context switching**: Agents toggle between 3-7 different systems per interaction (CRM, billing, knowledge base, order management), wasting 30-40% of handle time on navigation rather than resolution
- **Inconsistent quality**: Policy application varies by agent experience, mood, and workload — the same issue gets different resolutions depending on who handles it
- **Peak hour bottlenecks**: Support volume follows predictable daily/weekly patterns, but staffing for peaks means overstaffing during troughs (or understaffing peaks and degrading SLAs)
- **Knowledge base staleness**: Internal wikis and policy documents go stale; agents develop tribal knowledge that doesn't transfer when they leave

## Desired Outcome (After AI)

An agentic AI system that autonomously handles 60-90% of customer service interactions end-to-end — not just answering questions, but taking actions on behalf of customers: processing refunds, modifying subscriptions, updating account details, resolving billing disputes, and tracking orders. The system reasons over customer context, accesses backend systems via APIs, applies business policies consistently, and escalates to human agents only when confidence is low or the situation requires judgment beyond its scope. Human agents shift from handling routine queries to focusing on complex, high-value, or emotionally sensitive interactions.

### Success Criteria

| Metric                   | Target                              |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Autonomous resolution rate | > 60% of all interactions resolved without human handoff |
| Average resolution time  | < 3 minutes for AI-resolved interactions |
| Customer satisfaction (CSAT) | >= parity with human agents (within 5%) |
| Cost per interaction     | 40-60% reduction vs. human-only baseline |
| First-contact resolution | > 80% (vs. industry average of 70%) |
| Escalation accuracy      | > 95% of escalated cases genuinely require human judgment |
| Policy compliance        | 100% consistent policy application across all AI-resolved interactions |

## Stakeholders

| Role                        | Interest                                    |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| VP of Customer Experience   | Improve CSAT and NPS while reducing costs   |
| Head of Support Operations  | Reduce headcount pressure and agent burnout  |
| IT / Platform Engineering   | System integration, security, uptime        |
| Compliance / Legal          | Consistent policy application, audit trails, data privacy |
| Finance / CFO               | Cost reduction, ROI demonstration            |
| Product Team                | Feedback loop from support data to product improvements |
| Human Support Agents        | Role evolution from routine resolution to complex case handling |

## Constraints

| Constraint              | Detail                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Data Privacy**        | Customer PII handled in every interaction; GDPR/CCPA compliance required; data residency requirements for EU/UK customers; AI must not log or retain sensitive financial data beyond session scope |
| **Latency**             | Real-time conversational response required (< 3 seconds per message); backend API calls to billing/order systems must complete within 5 seconds; degraded performance must fall back to human queue, not fail silently |
| **Budget**              | LLM inference costs at scale are significant — Klarna-scale (2.3M conversations/month) at $0.01-0.05 per interaction still means $23K-115K/month in inference alone; must demonstrate ROI within 6 months |
| **Existing Systems**    | Must integrate with existing CRM (Salesforce, Zendesk, Intercom), order management, billing/payment systems, and knowledge base; cannot require wholesale platform replacement |
| **Compliance**          | Financial services interactions require audit trails; refund/credit actions above thresholds need human approval; AI must disclose its non-human nature where legally required (EU AI Act, state-level laws) |
| **Scale**               | Must handle 10K-500K conversations/month depending on company size; peak loads during sales events (Black Friday, product launches) can be 5-10x normal volume; graceful degradation required |

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Autonomous resolution of common service requests: order tracking, refunds/returns, billing inquiries, subscription modifications, account updates, FAQ-type questions
- Multi-turn conversational interactions with context retention within a session
- Real-time integration with CRM, order management, billing, and payment systems via APIs
- Policy-based decision making for refunds, credits, and account changes within defined thresholds
- Intelligent escalation to human agents with full context handoff when confidence is low
- Conversation analytics and quality monitoring dashboard
- Support for chat and email channels

### Out of Scope

- Voice/phone channel support (requires separate speech-to-text and voice synthesis infrastructure)
- Proactive outbound customer engagement (e.g., churn prevention campaigns)
- Sales and upselling within service interactions
- Training and workforce management for human agents
- Customer identity verification and fraud detection (handled by existing auth systems)
- Social media monitoring and response (different tooling and compliance requirements)
