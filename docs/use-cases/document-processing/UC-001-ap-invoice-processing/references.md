## Source Quality Notes

The business evidence for this use case is strongest on invoice coding, touchless rates, and cycle-time reduction. Most of that evidence comes from vendor-published case studies on named customers, so it is directionally strong but not independent. Technical design guidance is stronger because it is backed by official Microsoft, LangChain, and SAP documentation. Any ROI number in the evaluation that is not directly published by a named source should be treated as estimated.
