## Decision Summary

This is a strong use case when the operator has repetitive product catalogs, repeat trade lanes, and enough filing volume to justify connector work. The evidence is solid on domain complexity and named operator claims from Maersk, Flexport, and WiseTech, but thinner on independent cross-jurisdiction AI benchmarks. The business case holds if rollout stays narrow and broker-reviewed truth sets the thresholds.

## Published Evidence

| Deployment / Source | Published Metric | What It Shows |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------|
| World Customs Organization — HS overview | More than 5,000 commodity groups, used by 200+ countries and economies, covering over 98% of merchandise in trade; updated every 5-6 years | The classification base is standardized but large and dynamic. A customs AI system must work against a formal taxonomy, not free-form product tagging |
| Maersk — Trade & Tariff Studio launch and market update | After large-customer pilots, Maersk cites 5-6% average tariff overpayment, 20% of shipment delays caused by poor customs preparation, and only 50-55% FTA use where eligible | The value pool is not just labor. It includes recoverable duty leakage, delay reduction, and better use of trade preferences |
| Flexport Customs | AI auditor reviews 100% of entries before transmission; first-quarter residual error rate in manual compliance audits fell to 0.2% | A broker-in-the-loop operating model can use AI as a quality control layer, not just a drafting tool |
| HMRC Customs Declarations Service | Single API for asynchronous declaration submission, cancellations, and document upload, plus push and pull notifications | Government filing systems are formal message interfaces with operational feedback loops. Country adapters are real product work |
| European Commission ICS2 | ENS filings are required for economic operators bringing goods into or through the EU; full multi-modal rollout completed in 2025, with v3 message changes applied from 3 February 2026 | EU entry-security filing is a live, versioned compliance surface. Multi-country expansion requires explicit adapter and testing investment |
| WiseTech Global / CargoWise | WiseTech states its customs platform covers about 80% of the world’s international manufactured trade flows | Existing customs operating platforms are entrenched. The winning pattern is augmentation and integration, not a greenfield replacement UI |

## Assumptions And Scenario Model

| Assumption | Value | Basis |
|------------|-------|-------|
| In-scope annual declaration volume | 75,000 declarations/year | Estimated scenario for one broker team or one importer program with material cross-border volume |
| Current manual effort | 22-30 minutes per declaration | Estimated from multi-document comparison, HS lookup, origin checks, and filing preparation on repeat traffic |
| Fully or mostly touchless share at steady state | 40-60% of in-scope traffic | Estimated. Deliberately below the most optimistic vendor automation claims because first release is broker-supervised |
| Recoverable duty leakage on in-scope traffic | 0.5-1.0% of annual duty spend | Estimated conservative planning assumption, materially below Maersk’s published 5-6% overpayment signal |
| Loaded broker operations cost | $55-$70 per hour | Estimated enterprise labor rate for licensed customs expertise and supporting operations staff |

## Expected Economics

| Factor | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Current cost** | $1.5M-$2.6M/year | Estimated labor cost from 75,000 declarations at 22-30 minutes each and $55-$70 hourly loaded cost |
| **Expected steady-state cost** | $0.9M-$1.7M/year | Estimated. Includes reduced labor on routine traffic plus OCR, model, and platform operating cost |
| **Expected benefit** | $0.7M-$1.5M/year | Estimated. Mostly labor reallocation, plus modest duty-leakage recovery and lower rework on repeat SKUs |
| **Implementation cost** | $0.7M-$1.3M | Estimated. Covers one customs regime, one filing adapter, tariff and origin data services, review workbench integration, and evaluation harness |
| **Payback view** | 8-16 months after pilot go-live | Estimated. Faster if duty leakage is material or if filing volume is higher than the scenario baseline |

The economics support a targeted rollout, not a speculative global platform build. The ROI comes from repeatability and disciplined scope.

## Quality, Risk, And Failure Modes

| Area | Strength / Risk | Control Or Mitigation |
|------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| HS classification | Strength: the task is standardized and supported by formal tariff structures. Risk: short or commercial product descriptions can still be ambiguous | Use retrieval-bounded candidates, broker-approved item memory, and mandatory review on ambiguous or high-duty-impact items |
| Origin and FTA claims | Risk: documents can indicate production or shipping facts without actually proving preferential origin | Separate origin evidence detection from preference claiming. No preference claim without the required proof type and rule match |
| Filing adapter drift | Risk: country interfaces and message versions change, causing rejects or incomplete submissions | Treat each adapter as a versioned product with regression tests, dress rehearsals, and monitored reject codes |
| Screening and compliance | Risk: automated screening can create false matches or miss context that a compliance analyst would catch | Keep screening deterministic and route all matches for human adjudication before release |
| Evidence quality | Risk: several business outcomes come from operator or vendor claims, not independent audits | Pilot measurement against internal broker-reviewed truth must determine thresholds, not external marketing claims |

## Rollout KPI Set

| KPI | Why It Matters | Pilot Gate |
|-----|----------------|------------|
| Line-level classification accuracy to 6 digits | This is the core quality measure for draft usefulness | ≥ 92% on in-scope traffic against broker-approved truth |
| Straight-through draft rate | Measures whether the system removes meaningful manual work without hiding risk | ≥ 35% of in-scope declarations reach broker-ready or file-ready state without rekeying |
| Declaration reject rate caused by AI-prepared fields | A low reject rate proves the adapter and validator are doing their job | No worse than manual baseline during pilot; target improvement after threshold tuning |
| Broker override rate on repeat SKUs | High override rates indicate that the memory and candidate ranking are not learning | < 15% on repeat SKU and repeat supplier combinations by the end of pilot |
| Draft cycle time | Faster draft creation reduces dwell risk and improves broker throughput | Same-shift draft creation for routine cases; urgent cases in minutes, not hours |

## Open Questions

- Which jurisdictions beyond the first regime have sufficiently stable APIs, test environments, and tariff data access to justify the next adapter build?
- How much of the published duty-leakage opportunity is actually recoverable for a given importer once existing broker controls and negotiated preferences are taken into account?
- What is the right evidence threshold for origin and FTA claims on complex manufactured goods that cross multiple countries before import?
- Which declaration types should never be eligible for touchless handling, even after the model performs well on repeat traffic?
