summary: "International shipments require customs declarations built from bills of lading, commercial invoices, packing lists, and certificates of origin. Brokers manually classify goods, calculate duties, and file entries across dozens of national systems. Misclassification rates run as high as 40%, costing importers billions in penalties, overpaid duties, and container demurrage."

## Problem Statement

Every cross-border shipment requires a customs declaration before goods can clear port. Brokers assemble data from five to ten source documents -- bills of lading, commercial invoices, packing lists, certificates of origin, and shipper letters of instruction -- then classify each line item to the correct Harmonized System (HS) code, apply the right duty rate, screen for trade sanctions, and file the entry into the destination country's customs system. The World Customs Organization maintains over 5,000 commodity groups across 97 chapters, and national tariff schedules add thousands of subcodes on top.

The process is labor-intensive and error-prone. Industry data indicates that roughly 2 in 5 tariff codes are assigned incorrectly. Maersk's own analysis found that 5--6% of duties are overpaid on average due to lack of centralized classification data, and that 20% of shipment delays trace back to inadequate customs preparation. When a container sits idle at port, demurrage charges of $150--$300 per day escalate to $430+ per day after the first week. For a ten-container shipment delayed five days, that is $3,750 in avoidable port fees alone -- before accounting for downstream production stoppages or missed retail windows.

Customs brokerage is a $24.7 billion global market (2024), handling over 350 million entries per year at major integrators alone. Cross-border parcel volumes reached 2.1 billion units in 2023 and are growing at 22% year-over-year. The current staffing model -- specialist brokers doing manual document comparison and code lookup -- does not scale to meet this volume without proportional headcount growth.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | 350M+ customs entries/year at major integrators; 2.1B cross-border parcels in 2023 | Parcel volumes growing 22% YoY outpace broker hiring capacity |
| **Cycle Time** | 12--48 hours for documentary processing per entry | Each hour of delay risks demurrage charges of $150--$430/day per container |
| **Cost / Effort** | 5--6% average duty overpayment; $900M+ in tariff exposure identified by one platform alone | Overpaid duties and missed FTA utilization are direct margin leaks |
| **Risk / Quality** | ~40% misclassification rate; US penalties up to 80% of domestic value for fraud | Classification errors trigger penalties, seizures, and loss of trusted trader status |

## Current Workflow

1. **Document collection** -- Broker receives bill of lading, commercial invoice, packing list, and shipper instructions from the importer or freight forwarder, typically via email or portal upload.
2. **Data extraction and matching** -- Broker manually reads each document, extracts product descriptions, quantities, values, and origin details, and cross-references them for consistency.
3. **HS code classification** -- Broker looks up each line item against the national tariff schedule, interprets General Rules of Interpretation, and assigns a tariff code. Complex goods may require ruling requests.
4. **Duty and FTA calculation** -- Broker determines applicable duty rates, checks whether free trade agreements reduce the rate, and calculates total duties and taxes owed.
5. **Filing and compliance screening** -- Broker enters the declaration into the national customs system (e.g., ACE in the US, CDS in the UK), runs denied-party screening, and submits for clearance.
6. **Exception handling** -- Customs authorities flag entries for examination or additional documentation. Broker responds, provides supporting evidence, and resolves holds.

### Main Frictions

- Document formats vary by shipper, country, and trade lane, forcing brokers to re-learn extraction logic for each trading partner.
- HS code classification requires deep product knowledge; a single shipment of mixed goods can take hours of manual lookup.
- Compliance audits typically review only 5--10% of filed entries after the fact, leaving most errors undetected until a government audit surfaces them.

## Target State

An AI agent pipeline ingests trade documents on arrival, extracts structured data using document understanding models, and classifies each line item against the relevant national tariff schedule. The system cross-references free trade agreement eligibility, screens against denied-party lists, and assembles a draft customs entry. A licensed customs broker reviews flagged exceptions -- novel goods, high-value shipments, or low-confidence classifications -- while routine entries file automatically through the customs system API.

Human brokers shift from data entry and lookup to exception resolution, ruling requests, and advisory work. The system continuously improves classification accuracy by learning from broker corrections, binding tariff information rulings, and feedback from customs authorities.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Straight-through processing rate | 0--10% of entries file without manual rework | 70--80% of routine entries file autonomously |
| HS code classification accuracy | ~60% correct on first attempt (manual) | 95%+ accuracy to 6-digit level |
| Entry preparation time | 12--48 hours per entry | Under 2 hours for routine entries |
| Duty optimization | 5--6% average overpayment | Under 1% overpayment with FTA auto-matching |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **Licensed customs broker** | Accurate draft entries with confidence scores; ability to override and correct classifications; audit trail for regulatory defense |
| **Importer / trade compliance manager** | Visibility into duty spend, FTA utilization, and compliance posture across all trade lanes |
| **Freight forwarder** | Faster clearance to reduce container dwell time and meet delivery commitments |
| **Customs authority** | Accurate, complete, and timely declarations; machine-readable data for risk-based inspection targeting |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Commercial invoices and trade data contain sensitive pricing and supplier information; data residency requirements vary by jurisdiction |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with national customs filing systems (US ACE, UK CDS, EU ICS2, etc.) via certified EDI/API channels |
| **Compliance** | Licensed customs broker must remain the filer of record; regulatory accountability cannot be delegated to software |
| **Operating Model** | Classification models must stay current with WCO Harmonized System updates (5-year cycle) and country-specific tariff schedule changes (ongoing); FTA rules of origin require document-level proof |

## Evidence Base

| Source / Deployment | What It Proves | Strength |

## Scope Boundaries

- AI-assisted HS code classification and duty calculation with broker-in-the-loop review
- Free trade agreement eligibility matching and duty optimization
- Integration with national customs filing systems for declaration submission
- Denied-party and sanctions screening as part of the filing workflow

### Out of Scope

- Physical cargo inspection and border control operations
- Trade finance instruments (letters of credit, bank guarantees)
- Freight routing and logistics orchestration (covered by UC-200)
- Post-clearance audit defense and penalty negotiation
- Country-specific import licensing and quota management beyond tariff classification
