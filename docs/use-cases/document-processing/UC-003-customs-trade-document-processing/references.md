## Source Quality Notes

The evidence base is good on standards, filing-system mechanics, and operator-reported pain points. It is weaker on independently audited, cross-jurisdiction AI benchmarks.

Primary and official sources dominate the control-model sections: WCO for tariff structure, HMRC and the European Commission for filing and origin rules, and Trade.gov for screening infrastructure. Named operator sources from Flexport, Maersk, and WiseTech are useful for published deployment direction and scale, but they remain operator or vendor claims rather than neutral benchmarks. The economics in `evaluation.md` are therefore estimates built on conservative assumptions, not direct copies of any single source.

## Claim Map

| Claim Or Section | Source IDs |
|------------------|------------|
| HS classification is standardized, global, and changes on a recurring cycle | S1 |
| Recommended semi-autonomous broker-in-the-loop operating model | S2, S4, S7, S8 |
| Main value pools are labor reduction, duty-leakage recovery, and better customs preparation | S2, S3, S4 |
| Architecture should bound AI with tariff retrieval and deterministic validation | S1, S5, S6, S7, S10 |
| Country filing adapters must be treated as separate, versioned products | S5, S6, S7 |
| Origin and FTA claims require explicit proof handling, not inference from invoices alone | S8, S9 |
| Screening should stay deterministic and independently auditable | S11 |
| Existing customs operating platforms should remain the workflow anchor | S12 |
| First release should focus on one jurisdiction and repeat traffic | S5, S6, S7, S10 |
| Evaluation evidence is strongest on operator pain and filing complexity, weaker on universal AI benchmarks | S2, S3, S4, S12 |
| Expected economics are conservative estimates, not direct published benchmarks | S3, S4, S12 |
