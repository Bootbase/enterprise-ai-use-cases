## Problem Statement

Large enterprises sign thousands of commercial contracts each year. Every NDA, master service agreement, vendor contract, and licensing deal must be reviewed for non-standard terms, missing clauses, liability exposure, and compliance with internal policies. In most organizations, this review sits with a legal team that is outnumbered by the volume of incoming requests.

A mid-size corporate legal department handles 2,000-5,000 contracts annually. Each review takes 1-4 hours depending on complexity, and the queue creates a 5-15 day turnaround that frustrates business teams. The result is predictable: deals stall waiting for legal sign-off, or business teams bypass legal entirely, signing contracts with unfavorable terms that surface months later as disputes, write-offs, or compliance findings.

The core challenge is not reading speed — it is consistent application of the company's negotiation playbook across thousands of documents, dozens of contract types, and multiple jurisdictions. Human reviewers vary in experience, miss clauses under time pressure, and cannot scale linearly with deal volume.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | 2,000-5,000 contracts per year in a mid-size legal department; Fortune 500 legal teams handle 20,000-40,000 | Every contract queued for human review competes for the same small pool of attorneys |
| **Cycle Time** | 5-15 business days average turnaround for standard commercial contracts | Delayed contract execution directly delays revenue recognition and vendor onboarding |
| **Cost / Effort** | $600K+ annual cost for a team reviewing 500 contracts at ~4 hours each; large enterprises spend $2-5M on contract review labor | Senior attorney time spent on routine clause checking displaces higher-value advisory work |
| **Risk / Quality** | Inconsistent playbook enforcement; non-standard terms slip through under workload pressure | A single missed liability cap or auto-renewal clause can cost more than the entire review function |

## Current Workflow

1. Business team submits a draft or counterparty contract to legal via email, Slack, or a CLM intake form
2. Legal operations triages the request, classifies contract type, and assigns to an available reviewer based on subject matter and jurisdiction
3. Reviewer reads the contract end-to-end, compares each clause against the company's negotiation playbook and approved fallback positions
4. Reviewer drafts redlines for non-standard terms and flags clauses that require escalation to senior counsel or business leadership
5. Redlined contract returns to the business team for counterparty negotiation; subsequent rounds repeat the review cycle
6. Final version receives sign-off and is stored in the contract management system

### Main Frictions

- Playbook application is inconsistent — two reviewers redline different clauses on identical contract language depending on experience and workload
- Turnaround time grows linearly with volume; quarter-end and M&A surges create multi-week backlogs
- Reviewers spend 60-70% of review time on routine clause identification rather than judgment calls that require legal expertise

## Target State

An AI agent ingests incoming contracts, extracts clause-level content, and evaluates each clause against the company's negotiation playbook and risk policies. The agent generates a risk-scored summary with specific redline suggestions and plain-language explanations for each flagged issue. Low-risk contracts that conform to the playbook proceed with minimal human touch. Medium- and high-risk contracts route to human reviewers with the AI's analysis pre-populated, reducing their review from hours to minutes of focused judgment on genuinely ambiguous terms.

Human lawyers retain ownership of escalation decisions, counterparty negotiation strategy, and final sign-off on high-value or non-standard deals. The system enforces consistent playbook application across all contracts regardless of volume, reviewer availability, or time pressure.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Average contract review time | 1-4 hours per contract | 10-15 minutes for human review of AI-flagged issues |
| Turnaround time (submission to redline) | 5-15 business days | Same-day for standard contracts |
| Playbook compliance rate | Variable (reviewer-dependent) | 95%+ consistent clause coverage |
| Contracts reviewed without attorney intervention | 0% | 40-60% of low-risk, standard contracts |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **General Counsel / CLO** | Consistent risk posture across all contracts; defensible audit trail of review decisions |
| **Legal Operations** | Reduced backlog, clear triage rules, and visibility into review pipeline throughput |
| **Contract Reviewers (Attorneys)** | Pre-analyzed contracts with flagged issues so they focus on judgment, not reading |
| **Business / Procurement Teams** | Faster turnaround so deals and vendor onboarding are not delayed by legal queue |
| **Compliance / Risk** | Assurance that regulatory and policy requirements are checked on every contract, not sampled |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Contracts contain confidential commercial terms, pricing, and counterparty information; the system must run in a secure environment with access controls matching the CLM |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with existing CLM platforms (Ironclad, DocuSign CLM, Agiloft) and document storage; playbook rules must be maintainable by legal ops without engineering support |
| **Compliance** | Review decisions must produce an audit trail; regulated industries (financial services, healthcare) require explainability for why a clause was accepted or flagged |
| **Operating Model** | Lawyers must retain final authority on risk acceptance; the system augments review capacity, it does not replace legal judgment on escalated matters |
