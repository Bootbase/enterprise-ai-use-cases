summary: "Pharmaceutical companies must process hundreds of thousands of adverse drug event reports annually under strict regulatory deadlines. Manual ICSR processing consumes 2–4 hours per case and costs USD 686K/year per product. An agentic AI system autonomously handles intake, triage, medical coding, duplicate detection, and narrative drafting—achieving < 30 minutes per case with 50–65% specialist FTE reduction while maintaining human control over serious cases and causality assessment."

## Problem Statement

Pharmaceutical companies are legally required to collect, assess, and submit Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) for every adverse drug reaction reported against their products. The FDA's FAERS database alone contains over 31 million report entries, with approximately 700,000 new adverse event reports filed annually in the US. The EMA's EudraVigilance system holds 29.3+ million ICSRs across 16.9 million unique cases in Europe.

Each ICSR requires a trained pharmacovigilance specialist to manually extract data from unstructured sources (physician narratives, patient emails, clinical trial case report forms, published literature), code medical terms to MedDRA dictionaries, assess causality, write a clinical narrative, and submit the case electronically in ICH E2B(R3) format — all within strict regulatory deadlines (7 days for fatal/life-threatening events, 15 days for other serious events).

A single routine case takes 2–4 hours of specialist time from intake through submission. Large pharma companies employ thousands of full-time pharmacovigilance staff globally, with per-product safety data management averaging $686K/year. Despite this investment, the manual process is error-prone and struggles to scale with growing report volumes driven by expanded drug portfolios, post-marketing surveillance requirements, and increasing patient self-reporting.

## Business Case

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Per-product PV data management averages ~$686K/year. ICSR processing staff cost $38–$163/hr (median $44.20/hr). A mid-size CRO like ProPharma processes 2,000+ ICSRs/month — representing millions in annual labor cost. |
| **Time**        | 2–4 hours per routine ICSR (intake through submission). Serious/fatal cases require 7-day turnaround; other serious events require 15-day submission. Triage alone needs 24-hour turnaround. |
| **Error Rate**  | Manual MedDRA coding errors, missed duplicate reports, inconsistent causality assessments, and narrative quality issues are common. Regulatory inspections routinely flag data quality findings. |
| **Scale**       | ~700,000 AE reports/year in US alone (FDA FAERS). Large pharma companies handle tens of thousands of cases internally. Volume grows 10–15% annually with expanded portfolios and patient self-reporting. |
| **Risk**        | Late or inaccurate submissions trigger regulatory action — FDA warning letters, EMA non-compliance findings, potential market withdrawal. Missed safety signals can lead to patient harm and billion-dollar liability. |

## Success Metrics

| Metric                   | Target                                  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Processing time per case | < 30 minutes for routine cases (from 2–4 hours) |
| Manual effort reduction  | 50–65% reduction in specialist FTE hours |
| Data accuracy at intake  | > 90% field-level accuracy (ArisGlobal NavaX benchmark) |
| Regulatory compliance    | 100% on-time submission rate within 7/15-day deadlines |
| Touchless processing     | 40–60% of non-serious cases processed without human intervention |
| Signal detection improvement | 20% improvement in signal detection accuracy (Tech Mahindra benchmark) |
| Case prioritization      | 45% improvement in triage prioritization accuracy |
