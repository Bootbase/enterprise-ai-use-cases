## Problem Statement

Property and casualty (P&C) insurers process millions of claims annually through labor-intensive, multi-step workflows that combine document review, policy verification, weather/event validation, fraud screening, payout calculation, and audit — each requiring different expertise and different source systems. Allianz Group, one of the world's largest insurers with 128 million customers across ~70 countries, handles 95 million cases per year (260,000+ daily). In Australia alone, Allianz processed 28,221 claims across 10 major catastrophe events in 2025, with a single Queensland/NSW storm generating 5,000+ claims in days.

The core problem is that even low-complexity, high-frequency claims — such as food spoilage under AUD $500 caused by storm-related power outages — follow the same multi-day manual pipeline as complex claims. A claims adjuster must verify the claimant's policy covers the event type, cross-reference actual weather data against the claim location and date, screen for fraud indicators, calculate the payout per policy terms, and document the decision for audit. Each step requires a different system lookup and a different judgment call. For a sub-$500 food spoilage claim, this process takes several days (4+ days typical) and costs the insurer more in adjuster time than the claim itself is worth.

## Business Case

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Average claims adjuster salary in Australia: AUD $94,000-$102,000/year. Processing sub-$500 claims through the full manual pipeline costs more in labor than the payout. Bain estimates 20-25% reduction in loss-adjusting expenses at full AI adoption. |
| **Time**        | Low-complexity claims: 4+ days through manual pipeline. Each claim requires sequential policy lookup, weather verification, fraud screening, payout calculation, and audit documentation. |
| **Scale**       | Allianz globally: 95 million cases/year, 260,000+ daily. Australia: 28,221 catastrophe claims in 2025. Industry-wide: insurance AI deployments jumped 87% YoY. |
| **Risk**        | Catastrophe events create claim surges that overwhelm fixed-capacity teams, delaying payouts and damaging customer trust. Inconsistent fraud screening exposes insurers to both overpayment and wrongful denial. |

## Success Metrics

| Metric                          | Target                                           |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Claim processing time           | Same-day for eligible claims (from 4+ days)       |
| Agent pipeline completion       | < 5 minutes from submission to human-review-ready |
| Eligible claim automation rate  | > 80% of low-complexity claims processed through agent pipeline |
| Final decision authority        | 100% human — agents prepare, humans decide        |
| Loss-adjusting expense reduction| 20-25% reduction (Bain full-potential benchmark)   |
| Claims leakage reduction        | 30-50% reduction (Bain full-potential benchmark)   |
