summary: "M&A diligence requires reviewing 500–2,000+ contracts under tight deadlines, with lawyers spending 3.2 hours per contract on manual review. An agentic multi-agent system autonomously executes each step of the diligence pipeline—VDR ingestion, contract classification, clause extraction, cross-contract conflict detection, and draft memo generation—reducing 200 associate-days to under 5 days while maintaining partner control over final judgment."

## Problem Statement

Mergers and acquisitions, leveraged finance, fund formation, and antitrust filings all rest on manual review of thousands of contracts. A mid-market M&A deal typically requires reviewing 500–2,000 target-company contracts inside a 2–6 week diligence window. According to LegalOn's 2025 survey of 286 legal professionals, lawyers spend an average of 3.2 hours reviewing a single contract, meaning a 500-contract review represents almost 200 working days of associate effort.

The cost is severe: at AmLaw 100 hourly rates of USD 700–1,400 for senior associates, contract review alone on a mid-market deal can run USD 1.5–3 million in fees. Junior lawyers burn out reviewing boilerplate clauses. Human reviewers under deadline pressure miss change-of-control triggers, exclusivity clauses, MAC (material adverse change) language, and unusual indemnity provisions — exactly the items that blow up post-closing.

The barrier to enterprise adoption is not the model — it is grounding agents in firm-specific precedent and curated legal data without leaking client privileged information into third-party models.

## Business Case

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Senior associate rates at AmLaw 100: USD 700–1,400/hour. Contract review on mid-market M&A deal (500 contracts at 3.2 hrs/contract): USD 1.5–3 million in fees. A&O Shearman reports 30% reduction in contract review time. |
| **Time**        | Baseline: 3.2 hours per contract = ~200 working days for 500 contracts. AI reduces review time by 75–85%, targeting < 30 minutes/contract for partner-ready output. |
| **Error Rate**  | Human reviewers miss change-of-control triggers, exclusivity clauses, MAC language. Different reviewers classify the same clause differently (known quality issue). |
| **Scale**       | Large LBO/PE platform deal: 5,000–10,000 contracts. A&O Shearman: ~2,000 lawyers actively using agentic AI daily. Legal AI market: USD 2.1B (2025) → USD 7.4B by 2035. |

## Success Metrics

|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Contract review time (per contract) | 75–85% reduction (targeting < 30 min for partner-ready output from 3.2 hrs baseline) |
| End-to-end diligence time (500-contract deal) | < 5 working days from VDR access to draft memo (from ~200 associate-days baseline) |
| Cross-contract conflict detection | > 95% recall on known conflict patterns |
| Hallucination rate on cited authority | < 1% (grounded retrieval from firm-curated precedent) |
| Lawyer adoption rate | > 50% of M&A practice lawyers active within 12 months |
