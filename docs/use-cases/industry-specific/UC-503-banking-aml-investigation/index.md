summary: "Global financial institutions spend USD 190–214 billion annually on AML compliance, with 79% spent on personnel navigating alert queues. Transaction monitoring systems generate 90–95% false positives. An agentic AI system autonomously investigates alerts across 6–12 siloed systems, drafts SAR-quality narratives, and enables look-back exercises at machine speed—reducing per-alert cost from USD 30–6,000 by 40–60% while passing regulatory examination."

## Problem Statement

Anti-money laundering (AML) is the largest non-revenue cost center in modern banking. Globally, financial institutions spent roughly USD 190–214 billion per year on financial crime compliance in 2023–2024, with 79% spent on personnel. Rules-based transaction monitoring systems generate 200,000–500,000 alerts per year at a Tier-1 bank, of which 90–95% are false positives. Each alert requires pivoting through 6–12 disconnected systems to gather context — core banking, KYC/CDD, payment messaging, sanctions/PEP screening, adverse media, corporate registries, counterparty network analysis, and prior SAR history — then writing a structured narrative justifying escalation or closure.

Under-reporting risks regulatory enforcement (USD 3.09B BSA penalty for TD Bank in October 2024 — the largest US BSA penalty ever). The 2024–2026 regulatory environment (EU AMLR effective July 2027, EU AMLA direct supervision from January 2028 with fines up to 10% of annual turnover) has made the status quo untenable. Agentic AI is the only viable path to scale.

## Business Case

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Global compliance spend: USD 190–214B/year. US/Canada: USD 61B. EMEA: USD 85B. Per-alert cost: USD 30–60 for L1 triage, USD 1,000–6,000 for L2 investigation. HSBC deployment saves thousands of analyst hours per month. |
| **Time**        | Per-alert: 20 min (L1) to 22 hours (full investigation). HSBC Dynamic Risk Assessment cut time-to-detection to 8 days (down from weeks). Lucinity Luci reduces investigation "from hours to minutes." |
| **Scale**       | HSBC: 1.35 billion transactions/month across 40M accounts. Tier-1 bank: 200K–500K alerts/year. FinCEN FY2023: 4.6M SARs filed; 2024: >10,000/day. |
| **Risk**        | Regulatory enforcement: TD Bank USD 3.09B BSA penalty (Oct 2024), Danske Bank USD 2B+ (2022). EU AMLA fines up to 10% of turnover from 2028. Personal liability for compliance officers. |

## Success Metrics

| Metric                                  | Target                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alert volume reduction (intelligent scoring) | 40–60% reduction in alerts reaching human queues |
| True positive detection improvement     | 2–4× more confirmed financial crime caught |
| Per-alert L1 triage time                | < 2 minutes per alert (from 15–25 min baseline) |
| Per-alert L2 investigation time         | < 30 minutes per alert (from 4–22 hours baseline) |
| Time-to-detect suspicious account       | < 8 days from first alert |
| SAR narrative consistency               | > 95% consistency on the same evidence |
| Hallucination rate on cited evidence    | < 1% (grounded retrieval from bank's own systems) |
| Human-in-the-loop                       | 100% of SAR filings signed by human compliance officer |
