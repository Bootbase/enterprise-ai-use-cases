summary: "Telecom operators manage 150,000+ network elements with billions of daily telemetry points. NOC engineers face alarm storms where 70-90% of alerts are noise. An autonomous multi-agent system correlates alarms across RAN, transport, and core domains, identifies root cause, executes pre-approved remediation in minutes, and continuously optimizes RAN parameters based on real-time traffic—reducing mean-time-to-repair by 40% and network OpEx by 15-30%."

## Problem Statement

Telecom operators manage networks of staggering complexity — hundreds of thousands of cell sites, millions of network elements, and billions of daily data points from RAN, transport, core, and customer-facing systems. When a network fault occurs, human engineers in NOCs must manually correlate alarms across siloed OSS/BSS systems, identify root cause, and execute remediation — a process that takes hours and is error-prone during multi-domain failures.

The problem is compounding. 5G densification is multiplying network elements by an order of magnitude, while Open RAN architectures introduce multi-vendor interoperability challenges. NOC engineers face alarm storms where 70-90% of alerts are duplicates or noise. Manual operations cannot scale with the speed required for modern networks.

## Business Case

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | NOC staffing represents 15-30% of network OpEx. AI-driven operations reduce total network OpEx 15-30%. AT&T achieved ~90% cost reduction using fine-tuned small LMs versus large models. |
| **Time**        | Traditional MTTR for complex cross-domain faults: 2-8 hours. AI-driven self-healing reduces MTTR by 40%. AT&T's agentic AI proposes fixes in minutes versus hours of manual triage. |
| **Error Rate**  | NOC engineers misidentify root cause in 20-30% of complex incidents. Manual RAN optimization achieves only 60-70% of theoretical capacity. |
| **Scale**       | AT&T: 410 deployed AI agents. Vodafone: 70,000+ towers, 350M customer devices. Rakuten: 3.5M registered sites globally. Telecom AI market: $1.89B (2024) → $50B+ (2034). |

| Alarm noise reduction               | > 80% of alarms auto-correlated and deduplicated        |
| RAN energy consumption              | 25% reduction                                           |

| Human override capability           | 100% — engineers can intervene at any time             |
