summary: "Clinical trial patient recruitment is the single largest bottleneck in drug development. 80% of trials are delayed due to enrollment failures; patient recruitment accounts for 32-40% of total trial costs. An agentic AI system autonomously parses complex eligibility criteria, scans structured and unstructured EHR data in near real-time, scores and ranks patient-trial matches, optimizes site selection, and monitors enrollment velocity—reducing patient identification from weeks to hours while achieving 95%+ match accuracy and supporting FDA diversity action plans."

# UC-509: Autonomous Clinical Trial Patient Matching and Recruitment with Agentic AI

## Problem Statement

Clinical trial patient recruitment is the single largest bottleneck in drug development. Approximately 80% of clinical trials are delayed or closed because of enrollment failures. Patient recruitment accounts for 32-40% of total trial costs — roughly $1.89 billion annually in the US pharmaceutical sector alone. The average cost to recruit one patient is $6,500+, while replacing a patient who drops out costs $19,000+. Screen failures — patients evaluated but not qualifying — cost an average of $1,200 each at rates of 15-30% across therapeutic areas.

The manual process of matching patients in electronic health records (EHR) to complex, multi-criteria eligibility protocols is slow, error-prone, and fundamentally unscalable. Site coordinators manually review 50-100 charts per week, extracting data from unstructured clinical notes buried in EHRs. Each day a trial is delayed costs sponsors between $600,000 and $8 million in lost revenue from postponed product launch.

## Business Impact

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | $6,500+ per enrolled patient; $1,200 per screen failure. Recruitment = 32-40% of trial budget ($1.89B/year in US). Average Phase III trial: $11.5M recruitment cost. |
| **Time**        | 80% of trials delayed by enrollment. Average enrollment period: 12-18 months. Each day delay costs $600K-$8M in lost revenue. |
| **Error Rate**  | 15-30% screen failure rate. Manual chart review misses ~20% of eligible patients due to unstructured data in clinical notes. |
| **Scale**       | ~440,000 active clinical trials globally; average Phase III: 1,000-3,000 patients across 50-200 sites. Each site coordinator manually reviews 50-100 charts/week. |

## Success Criteria

| Metric                       | Target                                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Patient identification speed | From weeks to hours per cohort              |
| Screen failure rate          | Reduce from 15-30% to < 5%                 |
| Enrollment timeline          | 25-50% reduction vs. historical baseline    |
| Site activation time         | 30-40% reduction through automated feasibility |
| Patient-trial match accuracy | > 95% concordance with manual expert review |
| Diversity enrollment         | Meet FDA diversity action plan targets      |
| Coordinator time on screening| Reduce by 60-80% (from 15-20 hrs/wk to 3-5 hrs/wk) |
