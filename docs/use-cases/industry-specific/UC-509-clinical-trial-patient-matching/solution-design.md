# UC-509: Autonomous Clinical Trial Patient Matching and Recruitment — Solution Design

## Solution Overview

This solution deploys a multi-agent AI system that autonomously orchestrates clinical trial patient matching — from parsing complex eligibility criteria in trial protocols to scanning structured and unstructured EHR data, scoring patient-trial matches with explainable reasoning, and monitoring enrollment velocity across sites.

The architecture follows a plan-and-execute multi-agent pattern inspired by production systems like IQVIA's orchestrator agents and research frameworks like MAKAR (Multi-Agent Knowledge Augmentation and Reasoning). A central Orchestrator Agent coordinates four specialized worker agents: a Protocol Criteria Agent that decomposes eligibility requirements into machine-executable rules, a Patient Matching Agent that uses RAG over EHR data with medical Chain-of-Thought reasoning, a Site Optimization Agent that predicts enrollment performance using historical data, and an Enrollment Monitor Agent that tracks recruitment velocity and triggers corrective actions.

The system integrates with EHR platforms (Epic, Oracle Health/Cerner) via HL7 FHIR R4 APIs, retrieves trial definitions from ClinicalTrials.gov, and feeds results into Clinical Trial Management Systems (Medidata Rave, Veeva Vault). LangGraph provides graph-based orchestration with checkpointing and human-in-the-loop gates — critical for regulatory compliance and clinical safety.

## Data Flow

```
1. [Trigger]    → New trial protocol uploaded OR new patient data arrives via FHIR
2. [Parse]      → Protocol Criteria Agent extracts I/E criteria → structured JSON rules
3. [Retrieve]   → Patient Matching Agent queries FHIR APIs for structured data
                   + vector search over embedded clinical notes (RAG)
4. [Reason]     → LLM evaluates each patient against each criterion using medical
                   Chain-of-Thought → produces criterion-level verdicts + confidence scores
5. [Score]      → Patients ranked by composite match score (0-1); below-threshold
                   matches flagged for human review
6. [Optimize]   → Site Optimization Agent scores sites by predicted enrollment
                   velocity, patient proximity, and diversity targets
7. [Monitor]    → Enrollment Monitor Agent tracks velocity vs. plan; triggers
                   alerts when sites fall behind; recommends corrective actions
8. [HITL Gate]  → Low-confidence matches and corrective actions routed to clinical
                   team for approval before execution
9. [Sync]       → Approved matches and actions pushed to CTMS; audit log written

## Agent Pattern

| Aspect | Choice |
|--------|--------|
| **Pattern** | Multi-Agent Orchestrator-Worker with RAG |
| **Orchestration** | Graph-based (LangGraph StateGraph with conditional edges) |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Confidence-gated escalation (matches < 0.85 score routed to clinical reviewer) |
| **State Management** | Persistent checkpointed state (LangGraph checkpointer with PostgreSQL backend) |
| **Autonomy Level** | Semi-Autonomous (autonomous matching and monitoring; human approval for patient outreach and corrective actions) |

### Why This Pattern?

**Multi-agent orchestrator-worker** was chosen because clinical trial matching requires four distinct capabilities that benefit from specialization:

1. **Protocol parsing** requires document understanding and medical terminology extraction — a different skill than patient matching.
2. **Patient matching** requires RAG over heterogeneous EHR data with clinical reasoning — the most LLM-intensive step.
3. **Site optimization** requires statistical modeling over historical enrollment data — more analytical than generative.
4. **Enrollment monitoring** requires continuous time-series analysis with alerting — an operational pattern.

This mirrors production architectures at IQVIA and the research architecture of MAKAR. ClinicalAgent research demonstrated that multi-agent architectures outperform monolithic LLM approaches on clinical trial tasks.

| **Latency Target** | Single patient-trial match: p50 < 15s, p95 < 45s, p99 < 90s; batch cohort scan: < 4 hours for 100K patient records |
| **Scaling Strategy** | Horizontal pod autoscaling on AKS based on queue depth; separate scaling groups for each agent type |
| **Rate Limits** | Azure OpenAI provisioned throughput (PTU) for predictable latency; queue-based backpressure with Service Bus |
| **Caching** | Protocol criteria cached after parsing; FHIR patient snapshots cached for 24 hours; embedding vectors cached in AI Search index |
