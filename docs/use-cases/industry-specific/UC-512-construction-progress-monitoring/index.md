summary: "Construction megaprojects routinely overrun budgets by 30% and schedules by 40%. AI agents that compare daily 360-degree site captures against BIM models and project schedules detect deviations in real time, predict delays weeks earlier than manual tracking, and cut rework costs -- turning reactive schedule recovery into proactive intervention."

## Problem Statement

Construction projects depend on thousands of interdependent activities spread across large physical sites. Progress tracking today relies on manual site walks, spreadsheet updates, and subjective superintendent judgment. A project manager may discover a two-week slippage only after it has cascaded into downstream trades, when recovery costs are highest.

McKinsey estimates that 98% of megaprojects suffer cost overruns exceeding 30%, and 77% are more than 40% late. Global construction inefficiencies cost roughly $1.6 trillion annually. Rework driven by undetected deviations from plans accounts for 4-6% of total project cost. The root cause is not complexity alone but a persistent gap between what is planned and what is actually built, detected too late to correct cheaply.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | A large general contractor runs 50-200 active projects simultaneously, each with 10,000+ trackable activities | Manual tracking covers 5-10% of installed work weekly; deviations hide in the unobserved 90% |
| **Cycle Time** | Progress reports produced weekly or biweekly; delay discovery lags actual slippage by 2-4 weeks | Late detection multiplies recovery cost -- a deviation caught at week 1 costs a fraction of one caught at week 4 |
| **Cost / Effort** | Superintendent and project engineer documentation time: 8-12 hours/week per project | Senior field staff spend 20-30% of their time on reporting instead of managing subcontractors |
| **Risk / Quality** | Rework averages 4-6% of contract value; schedule disputes drive claims and litigation | Undetected quality defects behind walls or ceilings become change orders costing 5-10x the original install |

## Current Workflow

1. Superintendent walks the site daily or weekly, takes photos, and notes progress by area
2. Project engineer compiles observations into a schedule update, comparing percent-complete against the baseline CPM schedule
3. Weekly owner-architect-contractor meeting reviews schedule status, RFIs, and change orders
4. When slippage is detected, project manager negotiates acceleration with subcontractors or adjusts sequencing
5. Monthly cost reports reconcile earned value against actual spend; disputes escalate to claims

### Main Frictions

- Progress assessment is subjective and inconsistent across superintendents and shifts
- BIM models and schedules diverge from as-built conditions but no one systematically reconciles them
- Delay root causes surface weeks after the fact, when corrective options are limited and expensive

## Target State

AI agents using hardhat-mounted cameras, autonomous robots, or drones capture 360-degree imagery of the entire site daily. Computer vision compares each capture against the BIM model and CPM schedule to measure work-in-place at the activity level. Deviations from plan -- missed installations, out-of-sequence work, quality defects -- trigger alerts to project managers and subcontractor leads within hours.

Predictive models use pace-of-progress data to forecast delay risk on critical-path activities weeks before traditional methods would detect slippage. Project teams shift from reactive schedule recovery to proactive intervention: reassigning crews, adjusting sequencing, and resolving conflicts before they compound. Superintendents spend less time on documentation and more time managing work. Human judgment remains central for trade coordination, safety decisions, and stakeholder negotiation.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Site coverage per tracking cycle | 5-10% of installed work | 90-100% of installed work |
| Delay detection lead time | 2-4 weeks after slippage begins | Same week, with predictive alerts 2-4 weeks ahead |
| Rework cost as % of contract | 4-6% | Under 2% |
| Superintendent documentation time | 8-12 hours/week | 2-3 hours/week |
| Schedule overrun vs. baseline | 20-40% | Under 10% |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **Project Manager / Director** | Real-time schedule health across all active projects; early warning on critical-path risk |
| **Superintendent** | Reduced documentation burden; automated daily capture replacing manual photo logs |
| **Owner / Developer** | Objective progress data for draw requests and milestone payments; reduced dispute exposure |
| **Subcontractors** | Clear, evidence-based pace feedback; fair attribution when delays originate from other trades |
| **Estimating / Preconstruction** | Historical pace-of-work data to improve future bid accuracy |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Site imagery may capture workers and third-party property; must comply with local privacy regulations and labor agreements |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with BIM authoring tools (Revit, Navisworks), scheduling software (Primavera P6, Microsoft Project), and project management platforms (Procore, Autodesk Build) |
| **Compliance** | Progress claims tied to payment applications must be auditable; AI-generated percent-complete must reconcile with contractual earned-value definitions |
| **Operating Model** | Diverse site conditions (weather, lighting, confined spaces) challenge camera coverage; requires reliable connectivity for daily data upload |
