summary: "US physicians handle a median of 43 prior authorization requests per week, consuming 12 staff-hours and driving burnout while patients wait days for approvals. Agentic AI systems that ingest clinical documentation, match it against payer medical policies, and auto-adjudicate routine requests are reaching 85-90% real-time approval rates -- cutting submission times by 55-70%, reducing denial rates by up to 63%, and freeing clinical staff to focus on patient care."

## Problem Statement

Prior authorization -- the process by which health plans require advance approval before delivering certain treatments, procedures, or medications -- is one of the most labor-intensive administrative workflows in US healthcare. The AMA's 2024 physician survey found that practices handle a median of 43 PA requests per week, consuming roughly 12 hours of physician and staff time. Over a third of practices employ staff who work exclusively on prior authorization tasks.

Most of this work is still manual. The 2023 CAQH Index found that only 35% of medical prior authorizations move through fully electronic channels. The rest rely on fax, phone, and payer web portals -- each with different submission formats, clinical documentation requirements, and follow-up processes. A manual PA transaction costs providers $10.97 on average, compared to $5.79 for a fully electronic one.

The consequences extend beyond administrative cost. 87% of physicians report that PA requirements lead to higher overall healthcare utilization, as patients delay or abandon care while waiting for approvals. Geisinger Health Plan documented a 63% denial rate before deploying AI-assisted authorization -- denials that triggered appeals, rework, and delayed treatment across its 500,000-member population.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | US healthcare processes an estimated 100M+ PA requests annually; Cohere Health alone handles 15M+ submissions through its platform | Each request touches clinical staff, payer reviewers, and follow-up teams -- multiplying labor cost at scale |
| **Cycle Time** | Standard PA decisions take 4+ days on average; urgent requests require resolution within 72 hours under CMS rules | Treatment delays cause patient harm and care abandonment; 79% of physicians report patients paying out-of-pocket rather than waiting |
| **Cost / Effort** | $10.97 per manual PA transaction (provider side); 12 staff-hours/week per practice; practice PA staffing costs rose 43% from 2019-2024 | Administrative spend that produces no clinical value; diverts resources from direct patient care |
| **Risk / Quality** | Denial rates of 10-15% industry-wide; appeals consume additional weeks; coding and documentation mismatches drive preventable denials | Denials delay medically necessary care and create revenue leakage for providers; rework costs exceed the original submission |

## Current Workflow

1. Ordering physician determines that a treatment, procedure, or medication requires prior authorization based on the patient's insurance plan
2. Clinical staff gather supporting documentation -- chart notes, lab results, imaging, prior treatment history -- and identify the payer's specific submission requirements
3. Staff submit the request via fax, phone, payer portal, or electronic transaction, attaching clinical evidence to justify medical necessity
4. Payer utilization management team reviews the request against medical policy criteria, requesting additional documentation if the initial submission is incomplete
5. Payer issues approval, denial, or partial approval; denied requests enter an appeals process with additional clinical review rounds

### Main Frictions

- Each payer has different submission formats, clinical criteria, and portal workflows -- staff must navigate dozens of distinct processes
- Clinical documentation is often insufficient on first submission, triggering payer requests for additional information that restart the review clock
- Denial reasons are frequently opaque, making it difficult to craft effective appeals or prevent repeat denials for similar cases

## Target State

An agentic AI system monitors order entry in the EHR and identifies when a service requires prior authorization. It assembles the required clinical documentation from the patient record, maps it against the specific payer's medical necessity criteria, and submits through the appropriate electronic channel. Routine requests that meet policy criteria receive real-time auto-adjudication. Requests requiring clinical judgment are routed to human reviewers with pre-assembled evidence packages that reduce review time.

The system tracks pending authorizations, responds to payer requests for additional information, and flags denials for appeal with recommended response strategies. Clinical staff shift from data entry and phone follow-up to exception handling and complex case management. Physicians retain final authority over treatment decisions; the AI handles the administrative burden of proving medical necessity to payers.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Real-time auto-adjudication rate | 5-10% of requests | 85-90% of routine requests |
| PA submission time per request | 20-35 minutes manual | Under 5 minutes with AI assembly |
| Average time to payer decision | 4+ days standard | Under 24 hours for auto-adjudicated cases |
| Denial rate | 10-15% industry average | Under 5% with pre-submission policy matching |
| Staff hours per week on PA tasks | 12 hours per practice | Under 4 hours (exception handling only) |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **Ordering Physician** | Minimal disruption to clinical workflow; confidence that PA does not delay treatment |
| **Clinical / Admin Staff** | Elimination of repetitive data entry, fax, and phone follow-up across multiple payer portals |
| **Health Plan Medical Director** | Consistent application of medical policy criteria; auditability of auto-adjudication decisions |
| **Revenue Cycle Leader** | Reduced denial rates, faster cash collection, lower cost-to-collect |
| **Patient** | Faster access to approved care; fewer surprise denials and out-of-pocket costs |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | PA requests contain PHI (diagnoses, treatment history, lab results); all processing must comply with HIPAA and state privacy laws |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with EHR platforms (Epic, Cerner/Oracle Health, MEDITECH), payer portals, and HL7 FHIR APIs mandated by CMS-0057-F |
| **Compliance** | CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule (CMS-0057-F) requires standardized FHIR APIs, 72-hour urgent / 7-day standard decision timelines, and public reporting of PA metrics by 2026-2027 |
| **Operating Model** | Auto-adjudication must be explainable and auditable; payers require clinical rationale for each decision; state-level regulations restrict fully automated denials in several jurisdictions |

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- AI-driven clinical documentation assembly and payer-specific submission formatting
- Real-time auto-adjudication of routine PA requests against medical policy criteria
- Automated tracking of pending authorizations and response to payer information requests
- Integration with EHR order entry and payer FHIR APIs

### Out of Scope

- Clinical decision support for treatment selection (distinct from proving medical necessity to payers)
- Claims adjudication and payment processing (downstream of authorization)
- Pharmacy benefit prior authorization (different payer workflows and formulary systems)
- Peer-to-peer clinical review escalation (remains human-to-human)
