## Problem Statement

Commercial airlines operate fleets of hundreds of aircraft, each generating terabytes of sensor data per flight across engines, avionics, hydraulics, and airframe systems. Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) teams must decide when to pull an engine, replace a component, or ground an aircraft. Get it wrong in one direction and a $150,000-per-hour Aircraft on Ground (AOG) event disrupts operations and passengers. Get it wrong in the other and parts are replaced too early, wasting millions in usable component life.

The global commercial MRO market reached approximately $119 billion in 2025. Unplanned downtime alone costs the sector an estimated $33 billion per year. Traditional maintenance scheduling relies on fixed flight-hour or calendar-based intervals set by OEMs, supplemented by manual trend monitoring of select parameters. This approach cannot account for the operating context of individual aircraft: route mix, climate exposure, engine age, and fleet-specific wear patterns.

The operational problem sits at the intersection of engineering, supply chain, and flight operations. Maintenance planning teams, powerplant engineers, and line maintenance crews each hold partial views. No single team sees the full picture in time to act.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | A mid-size carrier operates 200-400 aircraft, each producing 1-2 TB of sensor data per flight | Manual trend monitoring covers a fraction of available signals; degradation patterns go undetected |
| **Cycle Time** | Maintenance planning horizons of 3-6 months for engine shop visits; days for unscheduled repairs | Short-notice AOG events cascade into crew reassignment, gate conflicts, and passenger rebooking |
| **Cost / Effort** | AOG events cost $10,000-$150,000 per hour; average engine shop visit runs $3-10 million | Premature removals waste remaining component life; late removals cause in-service failures |
| **Risk / Quality** | Maintenance-related cancellations and delays directly affect on-time performance and safety margins | Regulators require documented justification for deviating from OEM-prescribed intervals |

## Current Workflow

1. Aircraft sensors record engine parameters (EGT, vibration, oil pressure, fuel flow) and airframe data during each flight; data is downloaded post-flight or transmitted via ACARS
2. Powerplant engineers and reliability analysts manually review trend charts for a subset of monitored parameters, typically engine exhaust gas temperature margins and vibration levels
3. When a parameter crosses a threshold, an engineering order is raised and the aircraft is scheduled for inspection or shop visit during the next available maintenance window
4. Parts and materials are ordered based on historical averages and OEM recommendations, with limited visibility into actual component condition
5. Line maintenance crews execute work packages, often discovering secondary issues during inspection that extend downtime

### Main Frictions

- Sensor data volume far exceeds what human analysts can monitor; most signals are never reviewed until a failure occurs
- Fixed-interval maintenance schedules ignore actual component condition, causing both premature removals and missed degradation
- Parts demand forecasting relies on fleet-wide averages rather than per-aircraft condition, leading to stock-outs or excess inventory
- Siloed systems between engineering, supply chain, and flight operations delay coordinated response to emerging issues

## Target State

An AI-driven predictive maintenance system continuously ingests full-flight data records across the entire fleet, applying machine learning models trained on historical failure modes, environmental conditions, and fleet-specific operating profiles. The system identifies degradation patterns weeks to months before they become operational events, generates ranked maintenance recommendations with estimated remaining useful life, and triggers parts pre-positioning through supply chain integration.

Human engineers retain authority over all maintenance decisions. The system surfaces predictions with confidence scores and supporting evidence, enabling powerplant engineers to validate findings against their domain expertise. Maintenance planning teams use AI-generated forecasts to optimize shop visit scheduling, minimize AOG exposure, and balance workload across maintenance facilities.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Maintenance-related cancellations per year | 5,000+ (large carrier, pre-deployment) | Under 100 |
| Predictive parts demand accuracy | 55-65% | 90%+ |
| Unscheduled engine removals | 30-40% of total removals | Under 10% |
| Maintenance planning horizon | 3-6 months | 12-18 months |
| AOG events per 10,000 flights | Industry avg ~4-6 | Under 1.5 |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| VP of Technical Operations | Fleet-wide reliability dashboard; AOG reduction targets; regulatory compliance assurance |
| Powerplant Engineers | Explainable predictions with supporting sensor evidence; ability to override or adjust recommendations |
| Maintenance Planning | Optimized shop visit scheduling integrated with parts availability and facility capacity |
| Supply Chain / Materials | Per-aircraft parts demand forecasts with lead-time alignment; reduced emergency procurement |
| Flight Operations / Dispatch | Advance notice of aircraft requiring maintenance; minimal disruption to crew scheduling |
| Regulatory / Airworthiness | Documented model validation; audit trail for condition-based maintenance deviations |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Full-flight data records are proprietary to each airline; OEM data-sharing agreements govern access to reference failure libraries |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with airline MRO systems (e.g., AMOS, TRAX), flight data monitoring platforms, and ERP/supply chain systems (SAP) |
| **Compliance** | All maintenance decisions must comply with EASA/FAA airworthiness directives; condition-based maintenance programs require regulatory approval under MSG-3 or equivalent |
| **Operating Model** | Models must be retrained as fleet composition changes (new aircraft types, engine variants); latency requirements differ between in-flight alerting and long-horizon planning |
