## Problem Statement

Municipal building departments are the gateway for all construction activity. Every new home, commercial renovation, and infrastructure project must pass plan review before a permit is issued. Reviewers check submitted drawings against hundreds of zoning rules, building codes (IBC/IRC), fire codes, ADA accessibility requirements, and local overlay ordinances. A single residential application may trigger checks across six or more disciplines.

Most U.S. jurisdictions take two to four weeks for a first residential review cycle. High-growth cities face far worse outcomes. Austin averaged 345 days per residential permit as of 2022. San Francisco reported a 605-day average, with a backlog of over 1,300 applications — some dating to 2017. Los Angeles permitting for new housing took over a year. Staff shortages compound the problem: experienced plan examiners retire faster than replacements are certified, and departments compete with private-sector salaries they cannot match.

The cost falls on applicants, housing supply, and disaster recovery. After the January 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, thousands of homeowners needed rebuild permits simultaneously, turning a chronic bottleneck into an acute crisis that prompted a Governor's executive order.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | Large cities process 10,000–50,000+ permit applications per year across residential, commercial, and infrastructure categories | Each application requires multi-discipline review; volume spikes after disasters or zoning changes overwhelm fixed staff |
| **Cycle Time** | First review cycle averages 2–4 weeks in well-staffed departments; 6–12+ months in backlogged cities | Delayed permits stall construction, increase carrying costs for developers, and slow housing delivery |
| **Cost / Effort** | Plan examiners earn $70K–$120K; departments spend $500–$2,000+ in staff time per review depending on complexity | Revenue from permit fees often fails to cover review costs; overtime and third-party review contracts add further expense |
| **Risk / Quality** | Inconsistent application of codes across reviewers; incomplete submissions cause repeated review cycles | Code violations missed during review surface during inspection or, worse, after occupancy — creating liability and safety risk |

## Current Workflow

1. **Submission**: Applicant uploads architectural drawings, structural calculations, site plans, and supporting documents through an online portal or in person.
2. **Intake and routing**: A clerk checks completeness, assigns the application to review queues for each discipline (zoning, building, fire, plumbing, structural, accessibility).
3. **Plan review**: Each discipline examiner reviews the drawings against applicable codes, marks deficiencies, and writes correction notices.
4. **Correction cycle**: Applicant revises drawings and resubmits. The review-resubmit loop repeats — often two to four times — until all disciplines approve.
5. **Permit issuance**: Once all disciplines sign off, the department issues the building permit and collects final fees.

### Main Frictions

- Incomplete or non-compliant submissions waste examiner time on the first pass; applicants often do not know which codes apply until corrections are returned.
- Each discipline reviews sequentially or with limited parallelism, extending elapsed time even when individual reviews are short.
- Experienced examiners carry institutional knowledge about local overlay districts and edge cases that is not codified in searchable rule sets.

## Target State

An AI-powered pre-screening layer reviews submitted plans against digitized code rules before a human examiner sees them. The system uses computer vision to parse architectural drawings, matches spatial and dimensional data against zoning setbacks, lot coverage, height limits, and building code provisions, and generates a compliance report flagging violations with code citations. Applicants receive this report within one business day of submission, allowing them to correct obvious deficiencies before entering the human review queue.

Human plan examiners remain the decision authority. They review AI-flagged items, handle judgment calls on complex or ambiguous provisions (variances, overlay districts, novel structural systems), and issue the final approval. The AI layer handles the repetitive, rule-based checks that consume the bulk of examiner time — estimated at up to 90% of first-pass review effort — so examiners focus on cases that require professional discretion.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| First-pass review cycle time | 2–12+ months depending on jurisdiction | Under 10 business days for standard residential |
| Correction cycles per application | 2–4 resubmissions average | 1 or fewer for pre-screened applications |
| Examiner throughput (applications per examiner per month) | Varies; often 15–30 residential | 2–3x increase through AI-assisted triage |
| Applicant submission quality (% complete on first submit) | Estimated 40–60% pass completeness check | 80%+ with AI pre-check guidance |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **Building Department Director** | Reduced backlog, defensible code compliance, staff retention through reduced drudge work |
| **Plan Examiners** | Tool that handles routine checks accurately so they can focus on complex reviews; not a job-replacement threat |
| **Applicants (homeowners, developers, architects)** | Faster turnaround, clear guidance on deficiencies, predictable timelines |
| **City Manager / Elected Officials** | Housing supply acceleration, disaster recovery speed, constituent satisfaction |
| **Building Code Officials (ICC)** | Accurate interpretation of codes; digitized rule sets that stay current with code cycles |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Submitted plans may contain proprietary architectural designs; system must limit data retention and access to authorized personnel |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with existing permitting platforms (Accela, Tyler Energov, CityView, Salesforce) via API or file exchange |
| **Compliance** | AI findings are advisory; a licensed plan examiner must sign off per state law in most jurisdictions. The system cannot issue permits autonomously |
| **Operating Model** | Municipalities operate on annual budget cycles; procurement requires council approval and often multi-year pilot phases. Union agreements may constrain workflow changes |

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- AI-assisted pre-screening of residential and commercial building permit applications against zoning, building, fire, and accessibility codes
- Integration patterns with major municipal permitting platforms
- Human-in-the-loop review workflows where AI findings are advisory, not dispositive
- Applicant-facing compliance reports that reduce correction cycles

### Out of Scope

- Fully autonomous permit issuance without human sign-off
- Field inspection automation (post-permit construction inspection is a separate workflow)
- Land use and environmental review (CEQA/NEPA), which involves discretionary judgment beyond code compliance
- Procurement and change management strategy for municipal adoption
