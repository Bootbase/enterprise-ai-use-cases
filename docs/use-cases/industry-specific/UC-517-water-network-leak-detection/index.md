summary: "Water utilities lose an average of 30% of treated drinking water to leaks in aging distribution networks, costing US utilities alone $6.4 billion annually. An agentic AI system continuously monitors acoustic and flow data from networked sensors, classifies leak signatures, prioritizes repairs by severity and water loss cost, and dispatches field crews with sub-meter location accuracy — reducing non-revenue water by 50% or more."

## Problem Statement

Water utilities operate vast underground distribution networks — the US alone has over 2.2 million miles of pipes — with an average pipe age of 45 years and some cast-iron mains exceeding a century. These networks lose roughly 30% of treated drinking water before it reaches customers. In the US, that amounts to 2.7 trillion gallons per year in non-revenue water (NRW), costing utilities an estimated $6.4 billion in unrealized revenue. Globally, NRW losses reach 126 billion cubic meters annually, valued at approximately $39 billion.

Traditional leak detection is reactive and labor-intensive. Crews walk sections of the network with ground microphones and acoustic correlators, typically triggered by customer complaints or visible surface water. A manual survey covers a few kilometers per day and rarely revisits the same stretch within the same year. The result is that most leaks run for months before discovery. About 87% of total water loss comes from real losses — physical leaks and pipe bursts — rather than metering or billing errors.

Aging infrastructure, growing populations, and tightening regulatory targets for water loss (such as the US EPA's proposed Water Loss Audit requirements and the EU Water Framework Directive targets) are forcing utilities to move from periodic survey campaigns to continuous, network-wide monitoring.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | US utilities experience ~240,000 water main breaks per year across 2.2 million miles of pipe | Manual crews can survey only a fraction of the network annually, leaving most leaks undetected for months |
| **Cycle Time** | Average time from leak onset to detection is weeks to months; some run for years | Every day a leak goes undetected costs the utility water production, energy, and treatment chemical expenses |
| **Cost / Effort** | NRW costs US utilities $6.4B/year; main break repairs alone cost $2.6B/year | Labor-intensive detection and delayed repairs drive costs far above what continuous monitoring would cost |
| **Risk / Quality** | Undetected leaks cause road collapses, service interruptions, boil-water advisories, and contaminant intrusion | A single catastrophic main break can cost millions in emergency response and erode public trust |

## Current Workflow

1. Customer reports low pressure, discolored water, or visible water surfacing — or a routine survey cycle flags a segment for inspection
2. Leak detection crew dispatched with portable acoustic listening equipment (ground microphones, leak noise correlators)
3. Crew walks the target section, listening at valve and hydrant contact points to narrow the leak location to a 3–5 meter radius
4. Location marked for excavation; repair crew digs to expose the pipe and confirms the leak
5. Pipe section repaired or replaced; data logged in the utility's GIS/asset management system
6. No continuous monitoring resumes — the same section may not be surveyed again for a year or more

### Main Frictions

- Detection is reactive: most leaks are found only after they surface visibly or cause service complaints
- Manual acoustic surveys cover limited network length per crew-day and cannot scale to full network coverage
- Leak location accuracy with traditional correlators is often 3–5 meters, increasing excavation cost and time
- No continuous baseline exists, so slow-developing leaks and small leaks on plastic (PVC/PE) pipes go undetected

## Target State

An AI-driven continuous monitoring system deploys acoustic sensors or flow meters at hydrants, service connections, and district metered area (DMA) boundaries across the distribution network. Sensor data streams to a central analytics platform where trained models classify acoustic signatures against databases of millions of known leak patterns, or detect flow anomalies indicating new real losses. The system prioritizes each detected leak by estimated water loss rate, proximity to critical infrastructure, and repair cost, then generates work orders with sub-meter location coordinates for field crews.

Human operators retain authority over repair prioritization and excavation decisions. The AI handles the continuous surveillance, classification, and triage that manual crews cannot sustain at network scale. Where satellite or free-swimming inspection technologies are deployed, the AI integrates those data sources to provide a unified leak-risk view of the entire network.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Non-revenue water rate | 20–30% of treated water (US average ~19.5%) | Below 10% |
| Leak detection rate | 1.4 leaks found per crew-day (traditional acoustic) | 3.8+ leaks identified per crew-day (with AI-directed surveys) |
| Time from leak onset to detection | Weeks to months | Hours to days |
| Leak location accuracy | 3–5 meters | Under 1 meter |
| Network coverage per year | 10–20% of pipe miles surveyed | 80–100% continuously monitored |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **Water Utility Operations Manager** | Reduction in NRW losses that justifies sensor infrastructure investment; fewer emergency main breaks |
| **Field Leak Detection Crews** | Prioritized, accurately located leak alerts that reduce unproductive survey time and excavation rework |
| **Finance / Revenue Protection** | Quantifiable recovery of unbilled water to close the revenue gap without rate increases |
| **Regulatory / Compliance** | Auditable NRW reporting and evidence of active loss management to satisfy water loss audit mandates |
| **Municipal Leadership / Ratepayers** | Reliable water service, fewer street disruptions from emergency repairs, and responsible stewardship of a public resource |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Sensor data includes flow patterns that may indirectly reveal usage behavior; customer metering data subject to utility privacy regulations |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with existing SCADA, GIS, asset management (e.g., IBM Maximo, SAP PM), and hydraulic modeling platforms via OPC UA or standard APIs |
| **Compliance** | NRW reporting must meet AWWA M36 water audit methodology; sensor hardware in contact with potable water must hold NSF/ANSI 61 or equivalent certification |
| **Operating Model** | Many utilities operate under rate-regulated revenue structures — capital investment in sensors requires regulatory approval and demonstrable payback within 3–5 years |
