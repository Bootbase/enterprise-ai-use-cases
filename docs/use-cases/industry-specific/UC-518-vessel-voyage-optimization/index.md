summary: "Maritime operators spend over $126 billion annually on bunker fuel — their largest single cost — while facing IMO carbon intensity regulations that tighten each year. AI-driven voyage optimization uses vessel-specific digital twins, real-time weather and ocean data, and dynamic speed-routing algorithms to cut fuel consumption 4–12% per voyage and keep fleets compliant with CII ratings."

## Problem Statement

Commercial shipping moves roughly 80% of global trade by volume. Bunker fuel accounts for up to 60% of a vessel's operating expenditure, making voyage efficiency the single largest cost lever available to ship operators. A large container ship or Capesize bulk carrier can burn 150–250 tonnes of fuel per day; even small routing or speed inefficiencies compound into millions of dollars in waste per vessel per year.

Since January 2023, the IMO's Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulation requires every ship above 5,000 GT on international voyages to report its annual operational carbon intensity and receive a rating from A (best) to E (worst). Rating boundaries tighten roughly 2% per year, reaching 21.5% below the 2019 baseline by 2030. A vessel rated D for three consecutive years or E for a single year must submit a corrective action plan. The commercial consequences are immediate: charterers and cargo owners increasingly refuse D/E-rated tonnage, and brokers report rate discounts of 5–15% for poorly rated ships.

Traditional voyage planning relies on a navigator selecting a route from standard ocean tracks, applying weather-routing advisories from a third-party service, and manually adjusting speed orders. This process cannot continuously re-optimize against shifting weather windows, port congestion, charter-party constraints, and CII targets simultaneously. The result is suboptimal fuel burn, missed CII thresholds, and reactive rather than predictive fleet management.

## Business Case

| Dimension | Current State | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Volume / Scale** | Global bunker fuel market exceeds $126 billion annually; a single large vessel spends $5–15 million/year on fuel | Even a 5% efficiency gain across a 200-ship fleet produces eight-figure annual savings |
| **Cycle Time** | Voyage plans are set once pre-departure with periodic manual updates | Static plans cannot adapt to changing weather, currents, or port schedule shifts mid-voyage |
| **Cost / Effort** | Fuel is 50–60% of vessel OPEX; weather-routing advisory subscriptions add cost without closed-loop optimization | Advisory-only services provide recommendations but no continuous re-optimization or compliance tracking |
| **Risk / Quality** | CII rating boundaries tighten annually; D/E ratings trigger corrective action plans and charter-rate discounts of 5–15% | Fleet-wide CII non-compliance erodes earnings and vessel resale values; EU ETS adds direct carbon cost from 2024 |

## Current Workflow

1. **Pre-voyage planning** — Navigator selects a route using ECDIS charts, standard ocean tracks, and a weather-routing advisory service. Speed orders come from the chartering desk based on laycan windows.
2. **Departure and initial routing** — Vessel departs on the planned route. The bridge team monitors weather forecasts and may request updated advisories if conditions change significantly.
3. **Mid-voyage adjustments** — Master makes manual speed and course adjustments based on experience, updated weather faxes, and communication with the operations center. No systematic re-optimization occurs.
4. **Arrival and reporting** — Vessel submits noon reports (position, fuel consumption, speed) to the shore-based operations team. Data quality varies; manual entry introduces errors and delays.
5. **Post-voyage analysis** — Performance team reviews fuel consumption against the voyage estimate. CII data is compiled quarterly or annually for IMO reporting. Deviations are identified after the fact.

### Main Frictions

- Weather-routing advisories are one-way recommendations without closed-loop feedback on actual vessel performance or charter constraints.
- Noon reports are manual, low-frequency (once per day), and error-prone, limiting the accuracy of performance models.
- CII compliance is managed reactively — operators discover rating deterioration months after the contributing voyages.
- No single system integrates fuel optimization, schedule adherence, charter economics, and emissions compliance in real time.

## Target State

An AI-driven voyage optimization platform ingests high-frequency sensor data from the vessel (GPS, fuel flow meters, shaft power, draft, trim), fuses it with ocean weather forecasts, sea-state models, AIS traffic data, and port congestion feeds, and continuously computes the optimal speed profile and route for each voyage segment. The system builds a vessel-specific digital twin that reflects hull condition, engine degradation, and fouling state rather than relying on generic performance curves. Shore-side fleet managers receive a unified dashboard showing predicted fuel consumption, ETA accuracy, and projected CII rating per vessel and per fleet, with alerts when a vessel's trajectory threatens its annual CII target.

Human oversight remains central. Masters retain authority over all navigation decisions; the system provides recommendations and quantified trade-off analysis (e.g., "slowing 0.5 knots saves 12 tonnes of fuel but delays arrival by 4 hours"). Chartering desks use the platform's speed-consumption forecasts to set more accurate voyage estimates and speed warranties. Fleet decarbonization managers use the CII projection engine to plan fleet-level interventions — slow-steaming campaigns, hull cleanings, or vessel swaps — before ratings deteriorate.

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Fleet-wide fuel consumption reduction | 0% (no AI optimization) | 4–12% per voyage |
| CII rating compliance (% of fleet at C or above) | ~70% of global fleet (industry estimate) | >95% of managed fleet |
| Fuel-consumption forecast accuracy | ±10–15% (noon-report based) | ±1–2% (high-frequency sensor + digital twin) |
| Annual fuel cost savings per vessel | $0 | $100,000–$500,000 depending on vessel size and trade |
| CO₂ reduction per vessel per year | Baseline emissions | 500–2,000 tonnes reduction |

## Stakeholders

| Role | What They Need |
|------|----------------|
| **Fleet Operations Manager** | Real-time visibility into voyage efficiency across all vessels; alerts for CII trajectory deviations |
| **Ship Master / Bridge Team** | Actionable speed and course recommendations that respect safety, contractual, and navigational constraints |
| **Chartering / Commercial Desk** | Accurate speed-consumption curves for voyage estimation, speed warranties, and time-charter negotiations |
| **Sustainability / Decarbonization Manager** | Fleet-level CII projections, EU ETS exposure forecasts, and scenario planning for compliance strategies |
| **Technical Superintendent** | Hull and engine performance degradation signals from the digital twin to schedule maintenance interventions |

## Constraints

| Area | Constraint |
|------|------------|
| **Data / Privacy** | Vessel performance data is commercially sensitive; AIS data is public but sensor telemetry and fuel-consumption data are proprietary to the operator |
| **Systems** | Must integrate with existing ECDIS, VDR, and fleet management systems; connectivity at sea is limited (VSAT/LEO satellite with variable bandwidth) |
| **Compliance** | IMO CII and EEXI regulations, EU ETS from 2024, flag-state reporting requirements; all optimization must respect SOLAS safety-of-navigation rules |
| **Operating Model** | Masters retain ultimate navigational authority; recommendations must be advisory, not autonomous control; shore-side teams operate across time zones for global fleets |
