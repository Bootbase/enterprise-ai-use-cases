## Problem Statement

Regulated enterprises operate under a relentless tide of regulatory change. CUBE's RegPlatform tracks over 10,000 issuing bodies across 750 jurisdictions in 80 languages — and the volume is accelerating: Corlytics' 2025 Global Regulatory Risk Report found a 23% year-over-year increase in global regulatory enforcement actions across financial services and life sciences. Between 2016 and 2023, employee hours dedicated to complying with financial regulations and examiner mandates increased by 61%, and compliance operating costs have risen over 60% compared to pre-financial crisis levels (Deloitte). Financial services firms now spend 10-15% of annual revenue on compliance, with mid-size companies allocating $500K-$2M per year specifically to Regulatory Change Management (RCM) programs.

Today, compliance teams monitor regulatory changes by manually checking regulator websites, industry association bulletins, and legal news feeds — often dozens of sources per jurisdiction. A single regulation like MiFID II spans thousands of pages of primary text, implementing technical standards, and supervisory guidance. When a change is detected, compliance officers must read the new text, interpret which internal policies and controls are affected, draft updated procedures, route them through legal review, train impacted staff, and evidence the change for audit. This end-to-end process is slow, error-prone, and scales linearly with headcount. ING and Commonwealth Bank of Australia demonstrated the gap when they used AscentAI's platform to extract their applicable obligations from MiFID/MiFID II in 2.5 minutes — a task that previously required 1,800 hours of manual legal analysis (AscentAI / RegTech Analyst, 2025). The EU AI Act (enforced 2024-2026), the Colorado AI Act (effective June 30, 2026), and ongoing SEC/CFPB rulemaking are adding entirely new compliance domains that existing teams were never staffed to cover. The core problem is that regulatory knowledge management — ingesting, interpreting, mapping, and operationalizing regulatory text — remains a manual, human-bottlenecked process in an environment where the volume and velocity of change have outpaced any team's capacity to keep up.

## Business Impact

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Financial services firms spend 10-15% of annual revenue on compliance (Deloitte). Compliance operating costs have increased 60%+ since pre-financial crisis levels. Mid-size companies allocate $500K-$2M annually for RCM programs alone. A single missed regulatory change can trigger enforcement actions: Corlytics reports a 23% YoY increase in global enforcement actions in 2025. Fines for non-compliance routinely reach $10M-$1B+ (e.g., GDPR fines, AML penalties). |
| **Time**        | Extracting obligations from a single regulation like MiFID II required 1,800 hours of manual legal analysis at ING/CommBank before automation (AscentAI, 2025). Employee hours dedicated to compliance increased 61% between 2016-2023. Compliance officers spend 30-50% of their time on regulatory monitoring and change assessment rather than strategic risk management. |
| **Error Rate**  | Manual monitoring risks missing critical changes: checking dozens of regulator sites introduces human error and blind spots. Regulatory text is dense, technical, and often cross-references other instruments — misinterpretation of applicability is common. Manual obligation mapping frequently produces incomplete or outdated inventories that fail audit scrutiny. |
| **Scale**       | CUBE tracks 10,000+ regulatory issuing bodies across 750 jurisdictions in 80 languages. A global bank operating in 50+ countries must monitor hundreds of regulatory changes per week across banking, securities, data protection, AML, and consumer-protection regimes simultaneously. The EU AI Act alone added an entirely new compliance domain that requires mapping to existing risk and control frameworks. |
| **Risk**        | Missed or late implementation of a regulatory change exposes the firm to enforcement action, consent orders, license revocation, and reputational damage. Regulatory gaps discovered during examination can freeze business activity (e.g., failure to implement stress-testing requirements can halt new product launches). Cross-border regulatory conflicts (EU vs. US vs. APAC) create compliance ambiguity that manual processes cannot resolve at speed. |

## Current Process (Before AI)

1. Compliance analysts manually check regulator websites (SEC, FCA, EBA, APRA, MAS, BaFin, etc.), industry association bulletins, and legal news aggregators daily or weekly for new publications
2. When a new regulation, amendment, or guidance document is identified, a compliance officer reads the full text (often 50-500+ pages) and determines whether it applies to the firm's licensed activities and jurisdictions
3. The compliance officer maps the new or changed regulatory requirements to the firm's existing obligation register — a spreadsheet or GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) tool containing hundreds to thousands of line items
4. Affected obligations are flagged, and the compliance officer drafts a regulatory change assessment: what changed, what internal policies and controls are impacted, what actions are needed, and by when
5. The assessment is routed to Legal for review and interpretation of ambiguous provisions, then to the relevant business line for feasibility assessment
6. Policy and procedure documents are manually updated to reflect the new requirements, typically involving 3-5 rounds of redlining between Compliance, Legal, and the business line
7. Updated policies are routed through a formal approval workflow (often involving a Compliance Committee or Board Risk Committee)
8. Training materials are updated and mandatory re-certification is scheduled for impacted staff
9. The change is logged in the GRC system with evidence artifacts (assessment, approval records, updated policies, training completion records) for regulatory examination readiness
10. During regulatory examinations, the firm must demonstrate that every applicable change was identified, assessed, implemented, and evidenced — producing a complete audit trail on demand

### Bottlenecks & Pain Points

- **Volume overwhelm**: Compliance teams cannot keep pace with the velocity of regulatory output across multiple jurisdictions — changes are missed or assessed late
- **Language and jurisdiction fragmentation**: Regulations are published in local languages; cross-border firms must interpret and reconcile requirements across 10-50+ jurisdictions with different legal frameworks
- **Obligation mapping is manual and error-prone**: Connecting regulatory text to internal controls requires deep institutional knowledge that is concentrated in a few senior compliance officers
- **Knowledge concentration risk**: 2-3 senior compliance officers typically hold the institutional memory of which regulations apply and how they map to internal controls — their departure creates critical knowledge gaps
- **Assessment-to-implementation lag**: The end-to-end cycle from detecting a regulatory change to evidencing implementation typically takes 3-9 months, often exceeding regulatory deadlines
- **Audit preparation is labor-intensive**: Producing evidence that every applicable change was tracked and implemented requires assembling artifacts from email chains, shared drives, GRC tools, and policy repositories — a process that can consume weeks of team time before an examination
- **Reactive rather than predictive**: Current processes detect changes after publication; firms cannot anticipate regulatory direction or pre-position controls for upcoming requirements

## Desired Outcome (After AI)

An agentic AI platform that serves as the firm's regulatory nervous system — continuously monitoring regulatory sources worldwide, autonomously interpreting new and changed requirements, mapping them to the firm's obligation register and control framework, drafting impact assessments and policy updates, and orchestrating the end-to-end change management workflow from detection to evidencing. The system is modeled on production architectures from CUBE (RegPlatform, 10,000+ issuing bodies, 750 jurisdictions), AscentAI (Regulatory Lifecycle Management, used by ING and Commonwealth Bank), and Wolters Kluwer (Compliance Intelligence, launched Q4 2025).

The platform operates as a multi-agent system: a **Horizon Scanner Agent** continuously ingests regulatory publications from all applicable jurisdictions and languages, classifying them by relevance and urgency. An **Obligation Extraction Agent** parses regulatory text into discrete, machine-readable obligations and maps them to the firm's existing obligation inventory. A **Change Impact Agent** compares new obligations against current policies and controls, identifies gaps, and drafts a structured impact assessment. A **Policy Drafting Agent** generates redline updates to affected policy documents. A **Workflow Orchestration Agent** routes assessments and drafts through the appropriate approval chain, tracks deadlines, and escalates overdue items. An **Audit Evidence Agent** continuously assembles the audit trail — linking each regulatory change to its assessment, policy update, approval, training completion, and attestation records — so the firm is examination-ready at all times.

Human oversight is maintained through configurable confidence thresholds: high-confidence, low-impact changes (e.g., minor reporting format adjustments) flow through with compliance officer notification, while high-impact or ambiguous changes require explicit human review and approval before policy updates are activated.

## Constraints

| Constraint              | Detail                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Data Privacy**        | Regulatory texts are public, but the firm's obligation registers, gap assessments, and policy documents are highly confidential — they reveal the firm's control weaknesses and regulatory exposure. Cross-border data residency requirements apply when regulatory assessments reference client data or jurisdiction-specific business activities. GDPR, SOX, and sector-specific regulations govern how compliance evidence is stored and retained. |
| **Latency**             | Regulatory change detection must be near-real-time (within 24 hours of publication). Obligation extraction and applicability assessment should complete in minutes. End-to-end change implementation workflow operates on a days-to-weeks cadence. Batch processing is acceptable for overnight ingestion of new publications; real-time alerting is required for urgent supervisory notices and enforcement actions. |
| **Budget**              | Enterprise GRC and RegTech platform licensing typically runs $500K-$3M/year for large financial institutions. LLM inference costs for processing thousands of regulatory documents per month must be controlled. The ROI must be measured against reduced compliance headcount growth, fewer examination findings, and avoided enforcement penalties. |
| **Existing Systems**    | Must integrate with: GRC platforms (ServiceNow GRC, MetricStream, RSA Archer, OneTrust, BWise); policy management systems (PolicyHub, ConvergePoint, PowerDMS); document management (SharePoint, iManage); regulatory feeds (CUBE RegPlatform, Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence, Wolters Kluwer Compliance Intelligence, LexisNexis); workflow/ITSM (ServiceNow, Jira); identity (Azure AD/Entra ID, Okta). |
| **Compliance**          | The system itself falls under AI governance requirements (EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). Every automated assessment and policy recommendation must be explainable and auditable. The system must not autonomously activate policy changes without human approval for high-impact items. Regulatory examination bodies (OCC, FCA, ECB SSM, APRA) expect the firm to demonstrate human accountability for compliance decisions even when AI-assisted. |
| **Scale**               | A global bank monitors 200-500+ regulatory issuing bodies across 30-60+ jurisdictions. Peak volumes occur during major regulatory overhauls (e.g., Basel III.1 implementation, EU AI Act rollout). The obligation register may contain 5,000-50,000+ line items. The system must handle multi-language regulatory text (CUBE supports 80 languages). Concurrent users during examination periods may spike as multiple business lines and auditors access evidence simultaneously. |

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope

- Continuous automated monitoring of regulatory publications across all jurisdictions where the firm holds licenses or operates
- AI-powered extraction of discrete obligations from regulatory text (primary legislation, implementing standards, supervisory guidance, enforcement actions, consultation papers)
- Automated applicability assessment against the firm's regulatory perimeter (licensed activities, entity types, jurisdictions)
- Mapping of new/changed obligations to the firm's existing obligation register and control framework
- AI-drafted regulatory change impact assessments with confidence scoring
- AI-drafted policy and procedure redline updates for compliance officer review
- Automated workflow orchestration for assessment routing, approval tracking, deadline management, and escalation
- Continuous audit trail assembly linking regulatory changes to assessments, approvals, policy updates, and training evidence
- Multi-language regulatory text processing (at minimum: English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese)
- Regulatory horizon scanning and trend analysis: identifying upcoming regulatory themes and consultation papers that signal future requirements
- Integration with enterprise GRC platforms and policy management systems
- Dashboard and reporting for CCO, Board Risk Committee, and regulatory examination teams

### Out of Scope

- Autonomous policy activation without human approval (the system recommends and drafts; humans approve and activate)
- Regulatory lobbying, comment letter drafting, or engagement with regulators on the firm's behalf
- AML transaction monitoring and suspicious activity reporting (covered by UC-053)
- Legal advice or formal legal opinions — the system assists compliance officers but does not replace legal counsel
- Client-facing regulatory advisory or reporting
- Internal audit execution (the system provides evidence; Internal Audit performs the assessment independently)
- Regulatory reporting and filing (e.g., CCAR, DFAST, Solvency II QRTs) — these are separate operational processes that consume the obligation register as an input
- Custom regulatory training content creation (the system flags when retraining is needed but does not author e-learning modules)
