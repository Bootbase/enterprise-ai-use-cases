## Notes on Evidence Quality

| Note | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| AscentAI metrics (`CS2`) | The 1,800-hours-to-2.5-minutes result is the strongest published metric in this domain. However, it measures obligation extraction for a single regulation, not the full RCM workflow. ROI projections should apply this ratio conservatively to the broader process. |
| CUBE metrics (`CS1`, `CS5`) | CUBE publishes coverage breadth (10,000+ bodies, 750 jurisdictions) but not specific accuracy percentages for their RegLM's extraction or classification. Coverage is strong evidence; accuracy claims are inferred from market position and client base. |
| Academic benchmarks (`AR2`) | The 93% precision / 99%+ classification accuracy comes from a peer-reviewed study applying LLMs + knowledge graphs to the EU AI Act. These benchmarks apply to a single regulation in a controlled setting; production performance may vary. |
| Industry cost data (`AN1`, `AN2`) | Deloitte and Thomson Reuters/CUBE cost-of-compliance figures are survey-based with large sample sizes (2,000+ respondents). They represent industry averages, not specific firm measurements. |
