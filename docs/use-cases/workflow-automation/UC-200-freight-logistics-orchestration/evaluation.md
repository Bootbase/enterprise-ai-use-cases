## Evaluation Overview

The evidence base for AI in freight logistics is unusually strong because C.H. Robinson — the world's largest 3PL by freight under management — has published detailed operational metrics across multiple press releases, earnings calls, and conference presentations from 2024 through early 2026. Unlike many enterprise AI case studies, these numbers tie directly to audited financial results: margin expansion, productivity gains, and market share that show up in SEC filings.

## Baseline (Before AI)

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Quote response time** | 17-20 minutes average | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **Quote request coverage** | 60-65% answered (35-40% unanswered) | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **Quote accuracy** | ~96% | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **Order processing time** | ~4 hours through email queue | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **Freight classification time** | 10+ minutes per shipment | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **LTL automation rate** | ~50% | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **Missed pickup resolution** | Half-day manual effort per batch | C.H. Robinson pre-AI baseline |
| **Daily order capacity** | ~5,500 truckload orders requiring manual processing | C.H. Robinson volume |

## Published Results (After AI)

| Metric | Before AI | Published AI Result | Change |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Quote response time** | 17-20 min | 32 seconds | -97% (32x faster) |
| **Quote volume** | Limited by human capacity | 1.5M+ quotes delivered by AI agent | Quoting became machine-speed |
| **Order processing time** | 4 hours through queue | ~90 seconds | -99.4% |
| **Orders processed by AI** | 0 | 1M+ orders (as of March 2025) | 5,200+ customers served |
| **Labor hours saved (orders)** | 600 hours/day consumed | 600 hours/day freed | Direct productivity win |
| **Freight classification time** | 10+ min per shipment | 3 seconds (after training) | -99.5% |
| **LTL automation rate** | 50% | 75% | +50% relative improvement |
| **Classification labor saved** | 300+ hours/day consumed | 300+ hours/day freed | Direct productivity win |
| **Missed pickup automation** | 0% (all manual) | 95% of checks automated | 350+ hours saved daily |
| **Tracking updates (voice AI)** | Manual check calls | 318,000 updates in one month | Previously invisible data |
| **Predictive ETA accuracy** | N/A | 98.2% | Real-time prediction from billions of data points |
| **Productivity (shipments/person/day)** | 2022 baseline | 40% increase | Enterprise-wide, 2022 to 2025 |
| **Appointment scheduling** | Manual coordination | 3,000+ appointments/day across 43,000 locations | Machine-speed scaling |

## Quality Assessment

### Where the AI Excels

| Capability | Evidence | Interpretation |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Structured extraction from unstructured emails** | 5,500 truckload orders/day processed in 90 seconds; 5,200+ customers served | Email parsing was the decade-old barrier that LLMs broke. This is the core unlock. |
| **High-volume classification** | 2,000 LTL shipments/day classified in 3 seconds; 75% automation rate | NMFC classification with tool-grounded lookup is reliable enough for production at scale. |
| **Parallel exception resolution** | 95% of missed pickup checks automated; 100 simultaneous calls and decisions | The dual-agent pattern (caller + decider) dramatically outperforms serial human workflows. |
| **Voice-based carrier outreach** | 318,000 tracking updates captured in one month | Voice AI unlocks data that was previously invisible — carrier status communicated only by phone. |
| **Phased rollout with widening scope** | Started with 2,268 TL customers; expanded to 5,200+ across TL and LTL | Problem-first, phased approach produces validated ROI at each step. |

### Where Limitations Remain

| Capability | Evidence | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Novel commodity classification** | First-time classification takes 10 seconds vs. 3 seconds for known commodities | Unusual freight still requires more LLM reasoning time; truly novel commodities may need human expertise. |
| **Complex multi-party negotiations** | C.H. Robinson keeps strategic negotiations human-led | AI handles routine pricing; high-value contract negotiations require relationship judgment. |
| **Cross-border and compliance** | International shipments, customs brokerage remain out of scope | Regulatory complexity in cross-border logistics is not yet addressed. |
| **Accuracy at the margin** | Quote accuracy improved from 96% to 99.2%, but 0.8% still causes margin erosion | In razor-thin margin businesses, even small error rates compound across millions of transactions. |

## Cost Analysis

### Operational Costs (Mid-Size 3PL: 5,000 shipments/day)

| Component | Monthly Estimate |
|-----------|------------------|
| **LLM API calls** | $8k-$15k |
| **Voice AI** | $3k-$8k |
| **Compute** | $3k-$6k |
| **Message queue + storage + monitoring** | $2k-$4k |
| **Predictive ETA model** | $1k-$3k |
| **Total Operational** | **$17k-$36k** |

### ROI Calculation

| Factor | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Previous cost (monthly labor)** | $400k-$600k (150-200 FTEs) |
| **AI solution cost** | $17k-$36k |
| **Residual human effort** | $160k-$240k (40% productivity gain) |
| **Net savings** | $124k-$324k monthly |
| **Implementation cost** | $500k-$1M |
| **Payback period** | ~2-8 months |

## Financial Evidence

C.H. Robinson's published results:
- 40% productivity increase enterprise-wide
- 520 basis-point adjusted operating margin expansion (Q2 2025 to 31.1%)
- Orders agent saves 600 labor-hours daily
- Classification agent saves 300+ hours daily
- Stock price more than doubled during industry downturn

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

| Failure Mode | Mitigation |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Extraction errors from unusual email formats** | Start with highest-volume, most-structured customers; widen gradually |
| **NMFC misclassification on novel commodities** | Route uncertain classifications to human LTL specialists |
| **Voice AI misunderstanding** | Structured extraction from transcripts with confidence scoring; escalate low-confidence |
| **Confidence miscalibration** | Score confidence regularly against gold sets; recalibrate thresholds |
| **Service Bus queue backlog during peaks** | Independent scaling per agent type; provisioned LLM throughput |
| **Incomplete data visibility** | Map data sources before building; AI is only as good as pipeline |

## Next Steps

| Priority | Action | Expected Impact |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| High | Deploy quote extraction agent against highest-volume cohort | Fastest path to measurable labor savings |
| High | Build evaluation set (500+ labeled emails per transaction type) | Foundation for measuring and improving accuracy |
| Medium | Add order processing agent for top 100 customers | 600 hours/day labor savings potential |
| Medium | Deploy NMFC classification agent for LTL | 300+ hours/day savings; 75% automation target |
| Medium | Implement missed pickup dual-agent | 95% automation of checks; 42% fewer return trips |
| Low | Add voice AI for carrier tracking outreach | Captures previously invisible tracking data |
