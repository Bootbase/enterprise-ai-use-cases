## Problem Statement

Large enterprises run a structurally broken procurement model: a small number of strategic, high-value contracts get expert sourcing attention, while the long tail of suppliers — typically 80% of vendor relationships representing only 20% of spend — sits effectively unmanaged. Walmart, for example, has tens of thousands of "Goods Not For Resale" (GNFR) suppliers covering everything from store carts and fleet services to facility maintenance and IT consumables. In every case, the math of human-led sourcing is unforgiving: a single category manager can run perhaps 20–30 deep negotiations per year, while the supplier base is in the thousands.

According to Deloitte's CPO Survey, 65% of procurement leaders have limited or no spend visibility beyond their Tier 1 suppliers. McKinsey research highlights that maverick spend — purchases made outside negotiated frameworks — accounts for 20–30% of indirect spend leakage.

The structural problem is that **commercial negotiation itself is the bottleneck**. Tail-spend contracts still require multi-issue, multi-round, multi-party haggling — payment terms vs. price discount, volume commitment vs. lead time, warranty extension vs. termination clauses. Until recently, only humans could conduct this kind of dialogue. Pactum AI proved that an LLM-driven multi-agent system can autonomously chat with thousands of suppliers in parallel and reach signed agreements.

## Business Case

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Tail-spend negotiation savings of 1.5–15% per category. Walmart pilot achieved 1.5% (Canada 2019); US/Chile/South Africa expansion achieved 3% average. Maersk reported up to 15% on spot trucking rates. SUEZ UK delivered 2.5% targeted and 15% competitive purchasing reductions within 2 months. |
| **Time**        | Negotiation cycles compressed from weeks to minutes/days. Walmart reached agreement with tail suppliers in average of 11 days (vs. 3+ months). SUEZ contacted 2,000 additional suppliers in 2 months — volume no human team could reach. |
| **Error Rate**  | Human negotiations are inconsistent: outcomes vary by buyer skill, time, supplier rapport. Maverick spend accounts for 20–30% of indirect spend leakage. Agentic model applies same playbook consistently, 100% policy compliance on covered categories. Walmart reported 76% policy adherence improvement. |
| **Scale**       | Walmart expanded from 100-supplier pilot to thousands across US, Chile, South Africa. SUEZ scaled from zero to 2,000 suppliers in 2 months. Negotiations run in massive parallel, breaking the linear "1 buyer = 20–30 deals/year" bottleneck. |
| **Risk**        | Status quo risks include working capital trapped (extended payment terms can free hundreds of millions), compliance exposure on expired contracts, margin erosion, and supplier relationship deterioration from neglect. |

| Supplier ease-of-use                         | ≥ 80% rate chatbot easy to use (Walmart: 83%)                       |
| Negotiation throughput                       | ≥ 1,000 parallel negotiations per category manager per quarter       |
