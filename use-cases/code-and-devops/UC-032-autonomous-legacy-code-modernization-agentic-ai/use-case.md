## Problem Statement

Enterprises worldwide depend on 220–344 billion lines of COBOL code running on mainframes that process 95% of ATM transactions, 80% of in-person credit card swipes, and $3 trillion in daily commerce. These systems — many 30–60 years old — are maintained by a shrinking workforce whose average age is ~60 years old, with ~10% retiring annually and only 7% of the mainframe workforce under age 30. Organizations face a critical modernization imperative: migrate these mission-critical systems to modern languages and cloud platforms before institutional knowledge disappears entirely.

The problem is that traditional modernization approaches fail catastrophically. 74% of legacy modernization projects fail to complete (Advanced 2020 Business Barometer), and 67% of mainframe-to-cloud migrations fail outright (Modernization Intel). Projects routinely overrun budgets by 200%+, span 3–7 years, require teams of 40–50+ developers, and cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Commonwealth Bank of Australia spent AU$1 billion over 5 years to replace its core COBOL banking platform. The US Department of Defense spent $30M/year maintaining a single 54-year-old system processing 500,000 transactions/day.

Agentic AI systems — multi-agent architectures that autonomously analyze, decompose, translate, test, and validate legacy code — are now demonstrating the ability to compress these timelines from years to months while dramatically reducing cost, labor, and failure risk.

## Business Impact

| Dimension       | Description                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**        | Average modernization project costs $9.1M (2024, Kyndryl); ongoing mainframe operating costs of $30M+/year for large systems; global mainframe modernization market is $8.23B (2025) growing to $18.42B by 2034 |
| **Time**        | Traditional full rewrites take 3–7 years for major banking systems; 33 months for a 1.3M-line DoD system; consultant "rewrite factories" require years of sustained effort |
| **Error Rate**  | 74% of modernization projects fail to complete; 67% of mainframe-to-cloud migrations fail; 80% fall short of savings targets; budget overruns routinely exceed 200% |
| **Scale**       | 220–344 billion lines of COBOL in production globally; 92 of top 100 banks use mainframes; 71% of Fortune 500 companies rely on mainframes; 83% of global banking transactions run on mainframes |
| **Risk**        | Retiring COBOL workforce (fewer than 3,200 active COBOL developers in the US with federal clearances); loss of institutional knowledge embedded in undocumented code; compliance and operational risk if critical systems become unmaintainable |

## Current Process (Before AI)

1. **Assessment phase** (3–6 months): Consulting firm (Accenture, Deloitte, TCS, Infosys) inventories mainframe estate — applications, dependencies, data stores, batch jobs, transaction flows. Much of this is manual code reading because documentation is decades out of date or nonexistent.
2. **Planning phase** (2–4 months): Architects design target state (cloud platform, modern language, microservices vs. monolith). Business stakeholders prioritize which applications migrate first. Budget and timeline estimates are produced (frequently inaccurate by 2–3x).
3. **Rewrite phase** (12–48+ months): Teams of 40–50+ developers manually translate COBOL to Java/C# line by line in "rewrite factories." Each developer handles ~100–200 lines/day of complex business logic translation. Undocumented business rules must be reverse-engineered from code comments (often in the original programmer's native language, e.g., Danish at Bankdata).
4. **Testing phase** (6–12 months): Exhaustive regression testing compares outputs of original and modernized systems transaction by transaction. Discrepancies require tracing back through both codebases. Test coverage gaps are the primary source of post-migration defects.
5. **Parallel run** (3–6 months): Both systems run simultaneously in production, processing identical transactions, with outputs compared continuously. Any divergence halts cutover.
6. **Cutover** (1–4 weeks): Traffic is shifted to the modernized system. Rollback plans are maintained for 30–90 days.

### Bottlenecks & Pain Points

- **Undocumented business logic**: Decades of modifications by hundreds of programmers leave business rules scattered across millions of lines of code with no centralized documentation. At Bankdata (Denmark), COBOL code is written in Danish, poorly represented in any training data or documentation system.
- **Workforce scarcity**: Average COBOL programmer is ~60 years old. Fewer than 800 developers in the US have 15+ years on IRS or SSA codebases. 70% of organizations struggle to hire mainframe talent (Kyndryl 2025). Salaries for COBOL modernization consultants reach $150K+.
- **Catastrophic failure rates**: 74% of projects fail to complete. Key failure modes include loss of key talent mid-project, governance breakdowns, and misalignment between business stakeholders and technical teams over multi-year timelines.
- **Prohibitive cost**: Commonwealth Bank of Australia spent AU$1B. US federal agencies spend billions annually maintaining legacy systems they cannot afford to replace. Average project cost is $9.1M even for smaller systems.
- **Institutional knowledge loss**: When the last developer who understands a particular COBOL module retires, the knowledge of why certain business rules exist (not just what they do) is permanently lost. This makes even assessment phases unreliable.

## Desired Outcome (After AI)

Agentic AI systems autonomously handle the end-to-end legacy modernization pipeline: analyzing COBOL codebases to extract business logic hierarchies, decomposing monolithic applications into bounded domains, translating code to modern languages (Java, C#, JavaScript) with preserved semantics, generating comprehensive test suites, and validating functional equivalence — reducing multi-year, $10M+ projects to months-long efforts with 60–80% less human labor and dramatically higher completion rates.

### Success Criteria

## Constraints

| Constraint              | Detail                          |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Data Privacy**        | Financial transaction data, PII in government systems (IRS, SSA), GDPR for European banks (Bankdata). Code itself may contain hardcoded credentials or sensitive configuration. |
| **Latency**             | Translated systems must match or exceed mainframe transaction processing speeds (sub-second for online transactions, batch windows for overnight processing). No degradation in throughput. |
| **Budget**              | Average modernization project budget is $7.2–9.1M (Kyndryl 2025). AI tooling costs add $2–5 per 1,000 lines analyzed (GitHub Copilot benchmark). Cloud infrastructure costs during parallel run can double operational spend temporarily. |
| **Existing Systems**    | Must integrate with existing mainframe middleware (CICS, IMS, MQ), database systems (Db2, VSAM), job schedulers (JCL, CA7), and downstream consumers. Cannot break interfaces during migration. |
| **Compliance**          | Banking: Basel III/IV, SOX, PCI-DSS, OCC/FDIC examination requirements. Government: FedRAMP, FISMA, NIST 800-53. Insurance: state regulatory requirements. All require audit trails of what changed and why. |
| **Scale**               | Codebases range from 500K lines (mid-size insurer) to 70M+ lines (Bankdata) to 60M+ lines (SSA). Must handle batch processing of 500K+ transactions/day. Peak loads during month-end, quarter-end, tax season. |
